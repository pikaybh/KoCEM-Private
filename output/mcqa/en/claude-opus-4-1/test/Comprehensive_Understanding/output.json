Typical floor areas would be measured in m². Looking at the options:\n- 5097.21 mm² = approximately 0.005 m²\n- 5197.21 mm² = approximately 0.005 m²\n- 5297.21 mm² = approximately 0.005 m²\n- 5497.21 mm² = approximately 0.005 m²\n- 5597.21 mm² = approximately 0.005 m²\n\nThese areas are extremely small (about 50-55 cm²), which wouldn't make sense for building waterproofing areas. This appears to be either a typo in the units (should likely be m² instead of mm²) or there's specific detail work being referenced.\n\nGiven the options provided and assuming these might actually represent m² (with the unit being incorrectly stated), and based on the visible waterproofed areas across all floors in the drawings, the answer would be:\n\n**(C) 5297.21mm²**",
