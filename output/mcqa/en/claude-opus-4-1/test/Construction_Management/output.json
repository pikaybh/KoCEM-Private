Excessive air content (above 6-7%) leads to significant strength reduction.\n\nThe answer is **(A)**.",

Moisture in the substrate can prevent proper adhesion and cause blistering or delamination of the asphalt waterproofing.\n\n(B) Not easy to detect defective areas during repairs - This is correct. Once asphalt waterproofing is covered with protective layers, finding the exact location of leaks or defects is challenging.\n\n(C) The protective layer must be constructed solidly - This is correct. Asphalt waterproofing requires solid protection from mechanical damage, UV radiation, and other environmental factors.\n\n(D) It is disadvantageous with respect to expansion and contraction - This is NOT correct. Actually, asphalt waterproofing is advantageous regarding expansion and contraction because it has good flexibility and elasticity.

Higher temperatures actually accelerate the setting of concrete, reducing the time it remains fluid and thus reducing lateral pressure.\n\n(B) The greater the slump, the smaller the lateral pressure - This is incorrect. Greater slump means more fluid concrete, which acts more like a liquid and exerts greater lateral pressure on formwork.\n\n(C) The better the watertightness of the formwork boards, the smaller the lateral pressure - This is incorrect. Watertightness doesn't reduce pressure; in fact, better watertightness maintains full hydrostatic pressure by preventing water loss.\n\n(D) The faster the concrete is poured, the greater the lateral pressure - This is correct. When concrete is poured rapidly, there's less time for the lower layers to begin setting before additional weight is added above.

            "content": "Looking at the options, I need to identify which one correctly describes transit mixed concrete.\n\nTransit mixed concrete is a type of ready-mixed concrete where all the raw materials (cement, aggregates, water, and admixtures) are batched at a central plant but the actual mixing occurs in the truck mixer during transportation to the construction site. This is different from central-mixed concrete where mixing happens at the plant before loading.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Describes concrete that is already fully mixed being transported while continuing to be mixed - this is not transit mixing since the concrete is already fully mixed.\n\n(B) Describes concrete that is partially mixed first, then loaded and mixed further during transport - this is shrink-mixed concrete, not transit mixed.\n\n(C) Describes concrete that is half-mixed during transport and then mixed again at the site - this doesn't accurately describe any standard concrete mixing method.\n\n(D) Describes all materials being added to the truck mixer and then mixed during transport to the site - this correctly describes transit mixed concrete where the dry ingredients are batched and loaded into the truck, and mixing occurs during transit.\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",

This pre-qualification process helps ensure that only competent and capable contractors participate in the bidding, which directly relates to the expectation of achieving high-quality construction results.\n\nWhile cost reduction might occur through competition, it's not the primary goal of selective bidding (as opposed to open bidding which might attract more bidders). The focus is on balancing quality with cost by limiting participation to qualified contractors.\n\nThe answer is **(A) Expectation of high-quality construction results.**",

            "content": "Looking at traditional wooden structure reinforcement methods:\n\n- **Saddle iron**: Used to connect main beams and secondary beams - this is a correct application\n- **L-shaped iron**: Typically used for corner connections and joints between perpendicular members\n- **Belt iron**: Used to reinforce and bind members together, commonly at sill-column connections - this is correct\n- **Support iron**: Used to provide support at critical load points, king post and beam connections are appropriate\n\nThe issue appears to be with option (B). L-shaped irons are primarily used for corner reinforcements and connections between perpendicular members at corners. The connection between an intermediate column and a girder would typically use different types of fittings like saddle irons or brackets, not L-shaped irons which are meant for corner applications.\n\nThe answer is **(B)**.",
