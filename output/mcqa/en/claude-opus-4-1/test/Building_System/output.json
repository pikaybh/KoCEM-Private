Perhaps the values are 6, X on top and 4, 7 on bottom, but in different positions.\n\nFor balance: 6/7 = 4/X\nThis gives: X = 28/6 = 14/3 ≈ 4.67 - not matching\n\nOr: 6/4 = 7/X\nThis gives: X = 28/6 = 14/3 ≈ 4.67 - not matching\n\nOr: 7/4 = X/6\nThis gives: X = 42/4 = 10.5 - still not matching\n\nActually, wait - if the configuration is 6 and X in series on one side, and 4 and 7 in series on the other side, with ammeter between the junction points:\n\nFor balance: 6/X = 4/7\nTherefore: X = 6×7/4 = 42/4 = 10.5Ω\n\nI keep getting 10.5Ω which doesn't match the options. Let me try one more interpretation:\n\nIf it's 7/X = 4/6:\nX = 7×6/4 = 42/4 = 10.5Ω\n\nGiven that option (C) is 42, and my calculation keeps giving factors involving 42, let",

Peltier effect: When current flows through two different conductors connected at both ends, one end becomes hot and the other end becomes cold; this is the reverse phenomenon of the Seebeck effect."

The wet-bulb temperature is lower due to evaporative cooling.\n\n(B) If moist air is heated, the relative humidity increases.\nThis is incorrect. When moist air is heated at constant moisture content (constant specific humidity), the relative humidity decreases. This is because relative humidity is the ratio of actual vapor pressure to saturation vapor pressure, and saturation vapor pressure increases with temperature.\n\n(C) The greater the difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the lower the humidity.\nThis is correct. The difference between dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures (wet-bulb depression) indicates the humidity level. A larger difference means the air is drier (lower relative humidity), while a smaller difference indicates higher humidity. When the two temperatures are equal, the air is saturated.\n\n(D) With the same dry-bulb temperature, the higher the relative humidity, the smaller the specific volume.\nThis is incorrect. At the same dry-bulb temperature, higher relative humidity means more water vapor in the air. Since water vapor is less dense than dry air (molecular weight of H₂O = 18 g/mol vs. dry air ≈ 29 g/mol), moist air has a larger specific volume than dry air.\n\nThe answer is C.",

While managing pressure is important for system integrity, a pressure reducing valve does not prevent the reversal of flow or contamination of the water supply.\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",

Higher wind speeds create greater pressure differences across openings, driving more air through the building.\n\n(B) The greater the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors, the smaller the ventilation amount - This is INCORRECT. Actually, the opposite is true. Greater temperature differences create larger density differences between indoor and outdoor air, which increases the buoyancy-driven (stack effect) ventilation.

For L = 100 H:\nλ = L × I = 100 × 0.001 = 0.1 Wb-turns\nThis would mean Φ = 0.1/50 = 0.002 Wb per turn\n\nActually, if the flux is 10⁻² Wb = 0.01 Wb:\nλ = 50 × 0.01 = 0.5 Wb-turns\nL = 0.5 / 0.001 = 500 H\n\nThis matches option (D).\n\nThe answer is (D) 500 [H].",

This relationship seems correct.\n\n(B) Rise distance occurs with warm air supply. It would increase (not decrease) with larger temperature differences because warmer air is more buoyant. Higher velocity would carry the air further horizontally before it rises significantly.

For your reference, if there are more than five error reports, the answer will be changed. [Error report content] Since we are looking for the voltage across C1, shouldn’t it be option 3? C1 = C1/(C1+C2)*V. [Counterargument] When capacitors are connected in series, the voltage divides and the charge remains constant. Therefore, the voltage across C1 (v1) is Q (charge)/C1 (capacitance). Q (charge) = equivalent capacitance × V = (C1C2)/(C1+C2) × V. Thus, v1 = (Q/C1) = (C1C2/(C1+C2) × V)/C1 = (C2/(C1+C2)) × V.

When these bubbles move toward the discharge side, the pressure suddenly increases, causing the bubbles to collapse, resulting in severe noise and vibration—this phenomenon is called cavitation. The pressure at the pump's suction port must be higher than the saturated vapor pressure of the water at that temperature. Therefore, the pump should be installed as low as possible to minimize the suction head."

This is correct.\n\n(C) Increase the discharge head of the pump - This relates to the pump outlet conditions and doesn't directly affect the inlet pressure where cavitation occurs.

It can operate at a lower, more steady rate to replenish the storage tank over time between peak usage periods.\n\nThis approach is more economical because:\n- It avoids oversizing expensive heating equipment\n- The heater can run more efficiently at a steady rate\n- Storage tanks are generally less expensive than increasing heating capacity\n\nThe answer is **(B)** - Increase storage capacity but decrease heating capacity.",

Local exhaust systems should have dedicated ductwork separate from general HVAC systems. Combining them would contaminate the air conditioning system and potentially redistribute hazardous substances throughout the building, creating serious health and safety risks.\n\n(C) Using corrosion-resistant materials for exhaust systems - This is correct, as exhaust gases often contain corrosive substances that can damage standard materials.\n\n(D) Placing the exhaust fan at the end of the system to create negative pressure - This is correct design practice. It ensures that any leaks in the ductwork will draw air in rather than leak contaminated air out into occupied spaces.\n\nThe answer is **(B)**.",

Hydraulic elevators are actually limited to low-rise buildings (typically 2-6 floors) due to:\n- Slow speeds (usually under 150 feet per minute)\n- Practical height limitations (around 60-70 feet maximum)\n- The impracticality of very long hydraulic pistons\n- High-rise buildings use traction elevators instead\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",

Maintains stable operation throughout the lamp's operation\n\nLooking at the options:\n- (A) Increasing luminous flux is not the primary purpose\n- (B) Preventing noise is a secondary benefit but not the main purpose\n- (C) Improving power factor is also a secondary benefit of some ballasts\n- (D) Stabilizing the discharge by limiting and controlling current is the fundamental purpose\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",

[Reported error] Question 65: Reactive energy = W × sin(φ) × h (time) = W × sqrt(1-cos²θ) × (time) = 100 × sqrt(1-0.8) × 20/60 = 20 kVarh, so the correct answer is 2. [Additional error report] Since the power factor is 0.8, the reactive power is 60 kVar/h. For 20 minutes, which is one-third of an hour, the reactive energy is 1/3 of 60, or 20 kVarh. [Counter-argument] If the power factor is 0.8 and the power is 100 kW, then 100W = VI × 0.8. The apparent power is 125 VA. The sine of the angle is 0.6, so the reactive power is 75 var, and multiplying by 1/3 for 20 minutes gives 25."

Mushroom-type intakes are commonly used in theaters for quiet, draft-free air distribution.\n\n(C) Factory - Unit heater: This is appropriate. Unit heaters are commonly used in factories for spot heating and general space heating in industrial settings.\n\n(D) Hotel room - Single duct system: This is the most inappropriate. Hotel rooms typically use individual fan coil units, packaged terminal air conditioners (PTACs), or VRF systems for individual room control. Single duct systems are central air systems better suited for large open spaces, not individual hotel rooms where guests need personal temperature control.\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",

In this rule:\n- The thumb represents the direction of motion of the conductor\n- The first finger represents the direction of the magnetic field\n- The middle finger represents the direction of the induced current\n\nFleming's left-hand rule, on the other hand, is used for motor action (when current-carrying conductor experiences force in a magnetic field).\n\nFaraday's law describes the magnitude of induced EMF but not the directional relationship.\n\nKirchhoff's law deals with current and voltage in electrical circuits, not electromagnetic induction.\n\nThe answer is (A).",

Latent heat involves phase changes, which doesn't occur in hot water heating systems.\n\n(B) Compared to hot water heating, steam heating is better able to adjust temperature in response to load fluctuations.\n- This is incorrect. Hot water heating systems actually provide better temperature control and can respond more flexibly to load changes because water temperature can be varied continuously. Steam systems are more of an on/off operation.\n\n(C) For large buildings, hot water heating costs less in installation and maintenance than steam heating.\n- This is incorrect. Generally, steam heating systems are less expensive to install in large buildings because they require smaller pipe sizes (steam has lower density than water) and don't need circulation pumps for distribution.\n\n(D) Hot water heating has a large heat capacity and requires a long preheating time, so when operated intermittently, the preheating load becomes significant.\n- This is correct. Water has a high specific heat capacity, and the entire volume of water in the system must be heated up from cold conditions.

Hot water heating uses the sensible heat of water (temperature change), not latent heat. Latent heat involves phase changes, which doesn't occur in hot water heating systems.\n\n(B) Compared to hot water heating, steam heating is better able to adjust temperature in response to load fluctuations.\n- This is incorrect. Hot water heating systems actually provide better temperature control and can respond more flexibly to load changes because water temperature can be varied continuously. Steam systems are more of an on/off operation.\n\n(C) For large buildings, hot water heating costs less in installation and maintenance than steam heating.\n- This is incorrect. Generally, steam heating systems are less expensive to install in large buildings because they require smaller pipe sizes (steam has lower density than water) and don't need circulation pumps for distribution.\n\n(D) Hot water heating has a large heat capacity and requires a long preheating time, so when operated intermittently, the preheating load becomes significant.\n- This is correct. Water has a high specific heat capacity, and the entire volume of water in the system must be heated up from cold conditions. This makes hot water systems less suitable for intermittent operation compared to steam systems, which heat up more quickly.\n\nThe answer is **(D)**.",
