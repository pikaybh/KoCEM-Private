The heat of vaporization of the steam is used for heating. Advantages: 1. Steam has a high heat transport capacity due to its latent heat of vaporization. 2. It has a shorter preheating time and faster circulation compared to hot water heating. 3. The heating surface area can be smaller than that of hot water heating. 4. Installation and maintenance costs are low. Disadvantages: 1. The comfort level of heating is low. 2. It is difficult to adjust the heat output according to changes in heating load. 3. Noise can occur, and boiler handling skills are required. Hot water supply systems: Individual systems include the instantaneous type, storage type, and steam-water mixing type. Central systems include direct heating and indirect heating types."

            "explanation": "The unit of luminous flux is the lumen (lm). There have been several error reports regarding this question. Your feedback is appreciated and the answer will be updated if there are five or more reports. [Error Reports] Option 3: Luminance – cd/m². [Additional Reports] Some argue that option 3 is also correct, as luminance is given by dividing the luminous intensity over the apparent area, and its units are cd/m² or nit (nt). A higher luminance indicates greater resistance to ambient light, making screens more visible in bright stores or sunny living rooms. [Contrary Opinion] The correct answer is 1. The unit for luminance is both cd/m² and nt, while the unit for luminous flux is lm. [Further Clarification] 1. Luminous flux: lm (lumen), the total light output from a source. 2. Luminous intensity: cd (candela), brightness in a particular direction. 3. Luminance: nt (nit), cd/m², perceived brightness per unit area. 4. Illuminance: lx (lux), brightness of a place.
