For reference, the correct answer will be changed if there are five or more reports. [Error report] I think the correct answer is option 3. A flat slab bears the load mainly through columns to increase ceiling height, so the answer seems to be incorrect. [Counter-argument] After checking multiple textbooks, the correct answer is option 1. [Counter-argument] By definition, a joist slab is a one-way slab structure made with joists placed at regular intervals. Therefore, option 1 is correct! Option 3 can also be confusing, but since the flat slab structure has no beams, it does allow lowering the ceiling, as stated in textbooks!

[Error report details] An = [h - (number of bolts) × bolt diameter + Σ(slant length squared / 4 × perpendicular spacing)] × thickness = (160 - 2 × 22) × 8 = 928. Due to a problem error, the answer is about 896 mm², which is answer 3. [Counter argument to error report] Formula for calculating net sectional area in aligned arrangement: gross area (h × t) - (number of bolt holes × hole diameter × t) = (160 × 8) - (2 × 24 × 8) = 896. In this problem, the arrangement is aligned, not staggered. For high-tensile bolts 22T, the standard hole diameter is 22 + 2 = 24, so d = 24."
