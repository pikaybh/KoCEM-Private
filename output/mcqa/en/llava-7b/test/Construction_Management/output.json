The correct answer will be updated to reflect feedback if more than five reports are received. [Error report:] According to my studies, a 300mm Ã 300mm plate (30 cm square) is commonly used for plate load tests, where bearing capacity is determined by loading the plate and measuring settlement. [Counterargument:] Option 1 is correct. The bearing capacity test is the plate load test, and according to the standard (as referenced in the Eumunsa Construction Industry Engineer book), a 45 cm square plate (area of 2000 cmÂ²) is the standard."
