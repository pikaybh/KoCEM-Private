Divide this by the 8-ton truck capacity: 0.6×0.4×0.45×2.7×200 / 8 = 7.29 trucks. Since you need a whole number of trucks, round up, so the answer is 8 trucks."

The correct answer will be updated to reflect feedback if more than five reports are received. [Error report:] According to my studies, a 300mm × 300mm plate (30 cm square) is commonly used for plate load tests, where bearing capacity is determined by loading the plate and measuring settlement. [Counterargument:] Option 1 is correct. The bearing capacity test is the plate load test, and according to the standard (as referenced in the Eumunsa Construction Industry Engineer book), a 45 cm square plate (area of 2000 cm²) is the standard."
