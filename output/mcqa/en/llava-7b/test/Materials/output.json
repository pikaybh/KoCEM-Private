If there are more than 5 reports, the correct answer will be revised. [Error report] The correct answer is 3. Characteristics of AE agent: forms and evenly distributes minute independent air bubbles in concrete. The areas where bubbles are formed remain as air voids when dried, leading to a decrease in compressive strength. [Rebuttal] Answer 1 is correct. The textbook states that bleeding decreases. [Additional error report] The answer is 3 according to the workbook; it does not increase compressive strength. [Admin] Please verify with other textbooks and indicate the publisher when reporting. [Rebuttal] Since the question asks for the correct statement, 1 is correct—AE agent reduces unit water amount, which decreases bleeding. [Additional error report] The question itself is incorrect. According to another workbook, the same options are given but the question asks for the incorrect statement and the answer is 3, because it should be \"decreases\" compressive strength. Options 1, 2, and 4 are correct. [Additional error report] Options 3 and 4 are incorrect; 1 and 2 are correct. Please correct this: it decreases both bond strength to rebar and compressive strength. It’s true that bleeding and chemical resistance are improved. [Additional error report] In the workbook, the answer is 3, since it’s incorrect to say it increases compressive strength. [Admin] Please verify with other textbooks and indicate the publisher. [Rebuttal] It’s listed as answer 1 in previous question books. Unless the question itself is wrong, statement 1 is correct. Statements 3 and 4 are obviously incorrect. [Rebuttal] The question and answer appear as is on page 406, question 37 of the Sungandang book. The correct answer is 1."

            "explanation": "1. Cork board – Made by crushing cork bark, placing it into a metal mold, and heating it by hot air or superheated steam while compressing it. It's lightweight, elastic, and offers good insulation and sound absorption (used as sound-absorbing material in broadcast studios, insulation in ice factories, and flooring in computer rooms, etc.). 2. Particle board (chipboard) – Made by mixing small wood pieces with organic adhesives like synthetic resin glue, then heating and compressing into boards. It has no directional strength, can be made in large panels, and adhesives may be mixed with waterproofing or mold inhibitors. It provides good sound and heat insulation and has a smooth, hard surface. 3. Copenhagen rib – Used for acoustic control in auditoriums, theaters, and assembly halls or as a wall finishing material in general buildings. 4. Flooring board – A type of floorboard processed for the surface, grooved and tongued, and installed directly on floor frames (used in school classrooms, gymnasiums, churches, auditoriums, etc.). Cork board and particle board can be confusing, as both involve heat and compression, but cork board is made from cork, while particle board is made from wood pieces. Remembering these differences makes it easy to answer this question."

As a reference, the answer will only be changed if there are more than five error reports. [Error report] The correct answer is number 4, which is a method of wood preservation using oil-based preservatives like creosote oil (which is brown, inexpensive, unattractive, used for exterior use, can't be painted over, and has a strong smell unsuitable for indoor use), as well as coal tar, asphalt, and water-based preservatives. [Additional error report] The correct answer is number 4 as written in the technician’s manual. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Oil stain is widely used for staining wood due to its high penetration and low fading. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Creosote oil, suggested by others, is not a stain but an oil-based wood preservative. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Oil stain is the coloring agent for wood."
