Because the pipes are empty, steam moves quickly and the space heats up easily. 3. Since there is little water inside the radiators and pipes, there is little risk of damage from freezing. 4. It is suitable for large buildings such as offices, schools, and factories. Disadvantages: 1. It is difficult to control capacity from a central location, rooms are easily overheated, and due to low heat capacity, rooms quickly cool down when steam stops. 2. Not suitable for buildings with high ceilings such as theaters, cinemas, and auditoriums. 3. If the pipe slope is not appropriate, water hammer may occur, making loud noises. Types of steam heating include gravity return, mechanical return, and vacuum return systems."

Folding to A4 size also helps preserve the content of the drawing without distortion and allows it to be stored neatly in files or storage boxes."

We appreciate your feedback and will consider it for updating the correct answer. For reference, answer updates are made after five or more error reports. [Error report] Isn't option 4 also correct? Shouldn't natural environments be included in architectural exterior space as well? [Additional error report] I also agree with the above; it seems there are problems with the question. [Counterargument] According to the Donsia workbook, 'exterior space refers to an external environment that is not natural but intentionally and artificially created by humans.' [Counterargument] Exterior space is the space outside buildings; the term is often used when focusing on the significance or composition of the space between buildings. [Korean Dictionary] [Additional error report] Natural spaces are also considered exterior spaces. [Additional error report] Naturally occurring spaces are also considered exterior spaces.

In Korean homes, various activities, such as eating, sleeping, and hobbies, typically take place in the same room, contrasting with Western homes where each room often has a dedicated function (bedroom, living room, kitchen, etc.). This highlights the significant difference in flexibility between the two housing styles.

S traps are used for sinks and toilets but are prone to losing their water seal due to siphon action. P traps are used in sanitary fixtures and are more stable than S traps, with piping leading into the wall. U traps are used in horizontal pipes to prevent backflow of sewer gas, and drum traps are mainly used in kitchen sinks, less likely to lose their water seal than S or P traps. Grease traps are installed to prevent grease from adhering to and clogging drainpipes."
