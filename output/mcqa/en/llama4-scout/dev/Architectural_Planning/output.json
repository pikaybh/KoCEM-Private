        "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of efficiency rate in office building construction\nThe efficiency rate in office building construction refers to a measure that calculates how effectively the space in a building is being used for rentable purposes, as opposed to being lost to structural elements, common areas, or other non-rentable spaces.\n\n## 2: Define each term given in the options\n- Building area refers to the total area of the building.\n- Rentable area is the area that can be leased out to tenants.\n- Standard floor area might refer to a normalized or average floor area, but it's not a standard term used in this context as commonly as the others.\n- Total floor area could refer to the entire area of all floors in a building.\n\n## 3: Analyze option (A) - The ratio of building area to total floor area\nThis option seems to compare the building area (which could be interpreted as the area of the building itself, possibly excluding external walls or including only the usable space) to the total floor area (which could imply all floors). This doesn't directly relate to the concept of efficiency in terms of rentable space.\n\n## 4: Analyze option (B) - The ratio of rentable area to total floor area\nThis option directly compares the area that can be rented out (rentable area) to the entire floor area of the building. This ratio gives an indication of how much of the building's total space is available for rent.\n\n## 5: Analyze option (C) - The ratio of rentable area to building area\nThis option compares the rentable area (the space that can be leased) to the building area (which could be considered as the gross area of the building). This ratio essentially measures how efficiently the building's space is being used for rental purposes.\n\n## 6: Analyze option (D) - The ratio of rentable area to standard floor area\nThis involves comparing the rentable area to a \"standard\" floor area, which might not accurately reflect the total potential or actual usage of space in a building, as \"standard\" could vary.\n\n## 7: Choose the most appropriate definition of efficiency rate\nThe efficiency rate is most directly related to how much of the building's space can actually be rented out compared to its total potential space. The term \"efficiency\" in real estate and construction often refers to the percentage of a building's total area that can be leased or used for revenue-generating purposes.\n\n## 8: Conclusion\nGiven the context, the efficiency rate is best described as the ratio of rentable area to the total area that could potentially be used or is actually used for rentable purposes. The most accurate and commonly used term in the industry for this concept is the ratio of rentable area to building area, which directly reflects the efficiency of space usage.\n\nThe best answer is C.",

These methods differ in how the object is projected onto the planes of projection.\n\n## 2: Identify the projection methods\n- First-angle projection: In this method, the object is placed in the first quadrant, and the projections are drawn as if the object is viewed from the front, top, and side, with the front view taken as the primary view.\n- Third-angle projection: Here, the object is placed in the third quadrant, and similar to first-angle projection, views are taken from the front, top, and side but with a different configuration.\n\n## 3: Relate to architectural practices\nIn architectural and engineering practices, the choice between first-angle and third-angle projections can depend on the region or country.
