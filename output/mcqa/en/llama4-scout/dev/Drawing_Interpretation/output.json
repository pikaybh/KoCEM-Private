        "model_answer": "## Step 1: Determine the required evacuation capacity\nTo find the minimum total effective width of stairs 1 and 2 for the 5th floor of the training facility, we first need to understand the requirements for evacuation capacity. This typically involves calculating the total occupant load for the area and then determining the required egress width based on that load.\n\n## 2: Understand occupant load and egress requirements\nThe occupant load is usually calculated based on the square footage of the area and the occupant load factor for that type of space. However, without specific details on the occupant load or the exact usage of the 5th floor, we must infer that the question implies a standard or given occupant load that needs to be evacuated.\n\n## 3: Recall standard egress width requirements\nTypically, building codes (such as the International Building Code or IBC) specify that for most occupancies, the minimum required egress width is based on the occupant load. A common requirement is 0.3 inches (7.62 mm) of egress width per occupant.\n\n## 4: Consider the given options in relation to common codes\nWithout the exact occupant load, we consider that the options given (A: 4,200 mm, B: 4,800 mm, C: 5,400 mm, D: 6,000 mm, E: 7,200 mm) need to correspond to a calculated requirement based on occupant load and egress codes.\n\n## 5: Apply general knowledge of egress requirements\nFor many buildings, a common approach is to have stairs that can accommodate a certain number of people per minute. The International Building Code (IBC) suggests that for most buildings, 0.3 inches per person is used for calculating egress width, which translates to approximately 1 mm per person for simplicity in some calculations.\n\n## 6: Make an educated estimation\nGiven that a typical stair width is around 1,200 mm to 1,500 mm for a single stair and assuming a need for multiple stairs to meet egress requirements, the total width would need to accommodate a significant number of people.\n\n## 7: Choose the most appropriate answer\nWithout specific occupant load numbers or more detailed code requirements provided in the question, we rely on general principles. For a significant number of occupants, such as in a large office or training facility, a wider stair or multiple stairs are necessary.\n\n## 8: Consider typical stair widths and capacities\nA standard stair can handle about 60 people per minute per 12 inches (30 cm or 300 mm) of width. If we assume a need for a higher capacity, multiple stairs or wider stairs are required.\n\nThe best answer is B.",
