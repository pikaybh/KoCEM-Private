        "model_answer": "## Step 1: Determine the minimum requirements for hoop spacing in columns as per ACI or relevant code.\nThe maximum spacing for hoops in columns is typically governed by the code specifications. According to ACI 318, for a tied column, the maximum spacing of the hoops should not exceed the smallest of 16 times the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement, 48 times the diameter of the hoop, or 12 inches (305 mm) for seismic design, but for non-seismic or general cases, it often relates to 16 times the diameter of the longitudinal bar or a specific maximum spacing.\n\n## 2: Calculate based on the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement.\nGiven that the main bars are 4-D25, the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement (d) is 25 mm. So, 16 times the diameter of the longitudinal reinforcement = 16 * 25 mm = 400 mm.\n\n## 3: Calculate based on the diameter of the hoop reinforcement.\nThe diameter of the hoop (D) is 10 mm. So, 48 times the diameter of the hoop = 48 * 10 mm = 480 mm.\n\n## 4: Compare and determine the maximum spacing.\nThe maximum spacing should be the smallest of the calculated values from step 2 and step 3, which are 400 mm and 480 mm respectively. Therefore, the maximum spacing for hoops is 400 mm.\n\nThe best answer is B.",
