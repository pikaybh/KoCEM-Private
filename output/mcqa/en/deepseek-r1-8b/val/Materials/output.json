            "explanation": "An AE agent (air-entraining agent) is an admixture used in concrete construction to evenly distribute small air bubbles throughout the concrete. Concrete mixed with an AE agent is called AE concrete. As a surfactant with excellent foaming properties, the AE agent creates fine bubbles in the concrete, thereby improving durability, including resistance to freezing and thawing and to corrosion. Freeze-thaw action refers to the expansion that occurs when water within materials such as concrete or soil freezes and thaws, which can generate significant pressure and cause material failure."
