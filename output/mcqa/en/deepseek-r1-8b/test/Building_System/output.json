For your reference, if there are more than five error reports, the answer will be changed. [Error report content] Since we are looking for the voltage across C1, shouldn’t it be option 3? C1 = C1/(C1+C2)*V. [Counterargument] When capacitors are connected in series, the voltage divides and the charge remains constant. Therefore, the voltage across C1 (v1) is Q (charge)/C1 (capacitance). Q (charge) = equivalent capacitance × V = (C1C2)/(C1+C2) × V. Thus, v1 = (Q/C1) = (C1C2/(C1+C2) × V)/C1 = (C2/(C1+C2)) × V.

For this problem, you can use the first formula, but the second is also possible. For the second, you can calculate like this: 0.337 × (ventilation rate 0.5 × room volume 400) × temperature difference 20. The value 0.337 comes from 1000/3600 × 1.2 × 1.01, so you don’t necessarily need to memorize it."

            "explanation": "If the suction head is too high or the water temperature rises, some of the water at the suction side of the pump can evaporate and form bubbles. When these bubbles move toward the discharge side, the pressure suddenly increases, causing the bubbles to collapse, resulting in severe noise and vibration—this phenomenon is called cavitation. The pressure at the pump's suction port must be higher than the saturated vapor pressure of the water at that temperature. Therefore, the pump should be installed as low as possible to minimize the suction head."

If you misconvert the units, you might confuse 17.1mm with 171mm. For reference, 1m = 1000mm, so 20m = 20,000mm. The thermal expansion formula is L = 1,000 × pipe length × linear expansion coefficient × temperature change, giving L = 1,000 × 20 × 1.71 × 10^-5 × (60-10) = 17.1mm."

For your reference, the answer will be changed if there are more than 5 reports. [Reported error] Question 65: Reactive energy = W × sin(φ) × h (time) = W × sqrt(1-cos²θ) × (time) = 100 × sqrt(1-0.8) × 20/60 = 20 kVarh, so the correct answer is 2. [Additional error report] Since the power factor is 0.8, the reactive power is 60 kVar/h. For 20 minutes, which is one-third of an hour, the reactive energy is 1/3 of 60, or 20 kVarh. [Counter-argument] If the power factor is 0.8 and the power is 100 kW, then 100W = VI × 0.8. The apparent power is 125 VA. The sine of the angle is 0.6, so the reactive power is 75 var, and multiplying by 1/3 for 20 minutes gives 25."
