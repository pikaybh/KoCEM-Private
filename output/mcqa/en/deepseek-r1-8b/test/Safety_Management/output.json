Motivation factors, on the other hand, reflect the human tendency for self-actualization (achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, etc.), similar to Maslow's concept of self-actualization. [Additional Explanation] Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory - Motivation factors: responsibility, achievement, recognition, the work itself, respect, autonomy, empowerment - Hygiene factors: work environment, policy, management, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, wages, promotion, supervision. The following errors have been reported. Your opinions are highly appreciated, and the correct answer may be revised in the future based on your feedback. For reference, the correct answer will be revised if more than five error reports are received. [Reported Error] On the internet, promotion is classified as a motivation factor in Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. It is stated in a lecture by Professor Jangho Choi of Sogang University's School of Business. If so, option 2 (promotion) is also a motivation factor, so shouldn't option 2 also be considered correct? [Additional Error Report] Source: Naver Encyclopedia ~ In other words, 'motivators such as promotion' generally play a role in causing satisfaction, but this does not always mean they are unrelated to dissatisfaction. Promotion could also be considered correct."

They are not challenging and prioritize safety as the most important aspect at work. In contrast, the Theory Y view sees work as natural and not inherently disliked, with people striving for achievement if they agree with the goals, valuing both internal satisfaction and external rewards.

It identifies the inherent hazards of the system during system development and determines the risk levels of anticipated accidents. 2. FHA: Analysis of subsystems. 3. FMEA: A typical qualitative, inductive analysis method used in system safety analysis. It analyzes failures of all elements affecting the system as a cause to review their impacts. 4. ETA: One type of system model that uses safety of events to indicate system safety. Inductive but quantitative analysis technique. 5. CA (Criticality Analysis): Items with high risk, especially failures that directly lead to system damage or casualties, need special attention and analysis. 6. THERP: A technique developed to quantitatively evaluate human error in systems, developed by Swain and others as a human error prediction technique. 7. MORT: Uses an analysis tree named MORT, employing the same logical technique as FTA, to promote comprehensive safety in areas like management, production, design, and maintenance (to achieve a high degree of safety in high-risk places such as the nuclear industry). 8. OSHA: An analysis conducted to identify and control hazards and determine their safety requirements for personnel, procedures, and equipment used in all operational stages of the system (operation and support hazard analysis)."

Fool Proof refers to designing structures where human error does not lead to accidents—machines don't operate unless actions are performed in the correct sequence, and misoperation does not result in accidents, ensuring safety even if someone has no experience."

Oxford index: Also known as the WD (wet-dry) index, it is a weighted average of the wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures: WD = 0.85W (wet-bulb temperature) + 0.15D (dry-bulb temperature). Effective temperature: One way to indicate perceived temperature. The degree of coldness felt by a person is related not only to air temperature, but also to humidity, wind speed, and radiation; this index combines these effects to provide an indicator suitable for perception (apparent temperature or sensation temperature). Heat stress index: Expressed as the percentage of the required evaporation needed to keep the body in heat equilibrium relative to the maximum evaporation expected in a given environment. It is mainly used to assess hot working environments or forecast heat tolerance limits. (Required evaporation / Maximum evaporation). Kata temperature: The temperature measured by a kata thermometer, simply based on heat or cold sensation, does not constitute a composite index indicating individual strain due to environmental factors."

A minimal cut set is the smallest combination of basic events capable of causing the top event and represents the system's risk. A path set is a set of basic events that, if none occur, the top event does not happen; if all do, the system operates normally. A minimal path set is the smallest set contributing to system reliability. Increasing the number of cut sets is similar to increasing parallel configurations (like OR conditions), which means there are more ways for failure to occur, raising the system's risk level. Increasing the size of a cut set is akin to increasing serial configurations (like AND conditions), making failure less likely, thereby reducing risk, as in interlock concepts."

A minimal cut set is the smallest subset sufficient to cause the event. A path, and especially a minimal path, is the minimal set of events required for the system to succeed. The minimal path set shows conditions for system reliability."
