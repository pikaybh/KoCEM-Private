For your reference, if there are more than five error reports, the answer will be changed. [Error report content] Since we are looking for the voltage across C1, shouldn’t it be option 3? C1 = C1/(C1+C2)*V. [Counterargument] When capacitors are connected in series, the voltage divides and the charge remains constant. Therefore, the voltage across C1 (v1) is Q (charge)/C1 (capacitance). Q (charge) = equivalent capacitance × V = (C1C2)/(C1+C2) × V. Thus, v1 = (Q/C1) = (C1C2/(C1+C2) × V)/C1 = (C2/(C1+C2)) × V.

First, let's calculate the required total lumens for an average illumination of 100 lux in a classroom with a width of 7m, length of 10m, and a ceiling height of 3.5m:\n\nLuminous flux per lamp = 2000 lm\nRoom area = 7m (width) x 10m (length) = 70 square meters\nCeiling height = 3.5m\n\nIllumination in lux = Luminous flux per lamp / Room area x Ceiling height\n= 2000 lm / 70 m² x 3.5 m\n= 142.86 lux (approx.)\n\nAs we are aiming for an average illumination of 100 lux, let's assume that the room has a uniform light distribution and multiply the required lumens by a factor to account for any potential variations:\n\nRequired total lumens = Illumination in lux x Room area\n= 142.86 lux x 70 m²\n= 9,989,320 lm\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of fluorescent lamps needed using their combined luminous flux:\n\nCombined luminous flux of multiple lamps = 50% x Required total lumens (due to illumination utilization factor)\n= 0.5 x 9,989,320 lm\n= 4,994,660 lm\n\nLastly, we need to account for the light loss compensation factor of 1.5:\n\nTotal required luminous flux = Combined luminous flux of multiple lamps x Light loss compensation factor\n= (4,994,660 lm) x 1.5\n= 7,486,490 lm\n\nNow we can calculate the number of fluorescent lamps needed:\n\nNumber of fluorescent lamps = Total required luminous flux / Luminous flux per lamp\n= 7,486,490 lm / 2000 lm\n= 3,743 lamps (rounded up to the nearest whole number)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 16 lamps."

Calculate the partial pressure of water vapor using the saturation temperature and absolute humidity: p\\_v = ω/Tsat\n5. Calculate the total enthalpy of the air using the specific heat at constant pressure for dry air and water vapor, and the mass of each component: h\\_total = c\\_p(TDB) + Δh\\_vapor(p\\_v)\nwhere c\\_p is the specific heat at constant pressure for dry air = 1.01 kJ/kg·K, Δh\\_vapor is the latent heat of vaporization of saturated water at 0°C = 2501 kJ/kg\n6. Finally, calculate the enthalpy of 6 kg of moist air by multiplying the total enthalpy by the mass of air: h = h\\_total x 6 kg\n\nSubstituting the given values into these equations, we get:\n\nTDB = 20°C, Tsat = 18.4°C (for dry-bulb temperature of 20°C), or Tsat = 0.673 x 20°C = 13.5°C (for wet-bulb temperature of 0°C)\np\\_v = ω/Tsat = 0.015 kg/kg' / 18.4°C = 0.00649 kg/kg' or p\\_v = ω/Tsat = 0.015 kg/kg' / 13.5°C = 0.01127 kg/kg'\nh\\_total = c\\_p(TDB) + Δh\\_vapor(p\\_v) = 1.01 x 20°C + 2501 = 2612 kJ/kg or h\\_total = c\\_p(TDB) + Δh\\_vapor(p\\_v) = 1.01 x 20°C + 2501 = 2612 kJ/kg\nh = h\\_total x 6 kg = 2612 kJ/kg x 6 kg = 15672 kJ or h = h\\_total x 6 kg = 2612 kJ/kg x 6 kg = 15672 kJ\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 62kJ."

The pressure at the pump's suction port must be higher than the saturated vapor pressure of the water at that temperature.

Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n(35 \\* 0.3 + 26 \\* 0.7) / (0.3 + 0.7) = 28.9℃\nSo, the temperature of the mixed air will be 28.9℃. The correct answer is option A."

For your reference, the answer will be changed if there are more than 5 reports. [Reported error] Question 65: Reactive energy = W × sin(φ) × h (time) = W × sqrt(1-cos²θ) × (time) = 100 × sqrt(1-0.8) × 20/60 = 20 kVarh, so the correct answer is 2. [Additional error report] Since the power factor is 0.8, the reactive power is 60 kVar/h. For 20 minutes, which is one-third of an hour, the reactive energy is 1/3 of 60, or 20 kVarh. [Counter-argument] If the power factor is 0.8 and the power is 100 kW, then 100W = VI × 0.8. The apparent power is 125 VA. The sine of the angle is 0.6, so the reactive power is 75 var, and multiplying by 1/3 for 20 minutes gives 25."
