C1 = C1/(C1+C2)*V. [Counterargument] When capacitors are connected in series, the voltage divides and the charge remains constant. Therefore, the voltage across C1 (v1) is Q (charge)/C1 (capacitance). Q (charge) = equivalent capacitance Ã V = (C1C2)/(C1+C2) Ã V. Thus, v1 = (Q/C1) = (C1C2/(C1+C2) Ã V)/C1 = (C2/(C1+C2)) Ã V.

[Reported error] Question 65: Reactive energy = W Ã sin(Ï) Ã h (time) = W Ã sqrt(1-cosÂ²Î¸) Ã (time) = 100 Ã sqrt(1-0.8) Ã 20/60 = 20 kVarh, so the correct answer is 2. [Additional error report] Since the power factor is 0.8, the reactive power is 60 kVar/h. For 20 minutes, which is one-third of an hour, the reactive energy is 1/3 of 60, or 20 kVarh. [Counter-argument] If the power factor is 0.8 and the power is 100 kW, then 100W = VI Ã 0.8. The apparent power is 125 VA. The sine of the angle is 0.6, so the reactive power is 75 var, and multiplying by 1/3 for 20 minutes gives 25."
