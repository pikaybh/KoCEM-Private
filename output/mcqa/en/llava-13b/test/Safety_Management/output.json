Motivation factors, on the other hand, reflect the human tendency for self-actualization (achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, etc.), similar to Maslow's concept of self-actualization. [Additional Explanation] Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory - Motivation factors: responsibility, achievement, recognition, the work itself, respect, autonomy, empowerment - Hygiene factors: work environment, policy, management, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, wages, promotion, supervision. The following errors have been reported. Your opinions are highly appreciated, and the correct answer may be revised in the future based on your feedback. For reference, the correct answer will be revised if more than five error reports are received. [Reported Error] On the internet, promotion is classified as a motivation factor in Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. It is stated in a lecture by Professor Jangho Choi of Sogang University's School of Business. If so, option 2 (promotion) is also a motivation factor, so shouldn't option 2 also be considered correct? [Additional Error Report] Source: Naver Encyclopedia ~ In other words, 'motivators such as promotion' generally play a role in causing satisfaction, but this does not always mean they are unrelated to dissatisfaction. Promotion could also be considered correct."

They are not challenging and prioritize safety as the most important aspect at work.

It identifies the inherent hazards of the system during system development and determines the risk levels of anticipated accidents. 2. FHA: Analysis of subsystems. 3. FMEA: A typical qualitative, inductive analysis method used in system safety analysis. It analyzes failures of all elements affecting the system as a cause to review their impacts. 4. ETA: One type of system model that uses safety of events to indicate system safety. Inductive but quantitative analysis technique. 5. CA (Criticality Analysis): Items with high risk, especially failures that directly lead to system damage or casualties, need special attention and analysis. 6. THERP: A technique developed to quantitatively evaluate human error in systems, developed by Swain and others as a human error prediction technique. 7. MORT: Uses an analysis tree named MORT, employing the same logical technique as FTA, to promote comprehensive safety in areas like management, production, design, and maintenance (to achieve a high degree of safety in high-risk places such as the nuclear industry). 8. OSHA: An analysis conducted to identify and control hazards and determine their safety requirements for personnel, procedures, and equipment used in all operational stages of the system (operation and support hazard analysis)."

A minimal cut set is the smallest combination of basic events capable of causing the top event and represents the system's risk. A path set is a set of basic events that, if none occur, the top event does not happen; if all do, the system operates normally. A minimal path set is the smallest set contributing to system reliability. Increasing the number of cut sets is similar to increasing parallel configurations (like OR conditions), which means there are more ways for failure to occur, raising the system's risk level. Increasing the size of a cut set is akin to increasing serial configurations (like AND conditions), making failure less likely, thereby reducing risk, as in interlock concepts."
