Therefore, one side of the grout line is 10.8/25.4 cm per inch \\* 3mm = 0.6397 inches.\n\nOne square meter is equal to 100 square centimeters.

        "model_answer": "To calculate the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the volume of soil that will be excavated. We can do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the footing.\n\nThe length of the footing is 6 meters, the width is 1 meter, and the depth is 0.5 meters. So:\n\nVolume of soil = Length x Width x Depth\n= 6 m x 1 m x 0.5 m\n= 3 cubic meters\n\nNext, we need to calculate the weight of the excavated soil. We can do this by multiplying the volume of the soil by its unit weight:\n\nWeight of soil = Volume of soil x Unit weight\n= 3 m^3 x 1.8 t/m^3\n= 5.4 t\n\nNow we need to calculate how much the soil will swell after excavation. We know that it will swell by 25%, so we can multiply the original volume by 1.25 to get the swollen volume:\n\nSwollen volume = Original volume x Swelling factor\n= 3 m^3 x 1.25\n= 3.75 m^3\n\nNow we need to convert the weight of the excavated soil (5.4 t) to tons by dividing it by 1000:\n\nWeight of excavated soil (tons) = Weight of soil / 1000\n= 5.4 t / 1000\n= 0.0054 t\n\nFinally, we can use the weight of the excavated soil and the swollen volume to calculate how many trucks are needed:\n\nNumber of trucks = Weight of excavated soil / Swollen volume x Unit weight of truck\n= 0.0054 t / 3.75 m^3 x 6 t/m^3\n= 0.0187 m^3 per truck\n\nSince we need to transport the excavated soil in its entirety, we can calculate the number of trucks needed by dividing the total volume of soil (3 m^3) by the volume per truck:\n\nNumber of trucks = Total volume of soil / Volume per truck\n= 3 m^3 / 0.0187 m^3/truck\n= 164 trucks\n\nHowever, this answer does not make sense in the context of a typical construction project. Therefore, it is likely that there is an error in the problem statement or in the calculation. Let's try again using a different approach.\n\nWe can start by calculating the weight of the excavated soil in its swollen state:\n\nSwollen volume = 3 m^3 x 1.25\n= 3.75 m^3\n\nWeight of excavated soil (tons) = Swollen volume x Unit weight of soil\n= 3.75 m^3 x 1.8 t/m^3\n= 6.9 tons\n\nNow we can calculate how many trucks are needed:\n\nNumber of trucks = Total weight of excavated soil / Weight capacity of truck\n= 6.9 tons / 6 t/truck\n= 1.15 trucks (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 12 trucks.",

Since each stack contains 12 bags of cement, we can assume that each bag is roughly the same size and shape as the others.

The correct answer will be updated to reflect feedback if more than five reports are received. [Error report:] According to my studies, a 300mm Ã 300mm plate (30 cm square) is commonly used for plate load tests, where bearing capacity is determined by loading the plate and measuring settlement. [Counterargument:] Option 1 is correct. The bearing capacity test is the plate load test, and according to the standard (as referenced in the Eumunsa Construction Industry Engineer book), a 45 cm square plate (area of 2000 cmÂ²) is the standard."
