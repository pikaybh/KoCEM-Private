To convert these measurements into meters, we can divide each dimension by 100:\n\nVolume of one brick = (190/100) x (90/100) x (57/100) m³ = 0.218 m³\n\nNow, we need to calculate the volume of the wall. The wall has a thickness of 1.5 bricks, so we will multiply the dimensions by 1.5:\n\nVolume of wall = (40/100) x (6/100) x (3/100) m³ x 1.5 = 2.7 m³\n\nSince we are using clay bricks, we need to account for the voids within the brick structure. The average porosity of a clay brick wall is around 30%, which means that about 30% of the space within the wall is filled with air or other gases. To calculate the actual volume of the wall, we can multiply the total volume by the porosity:\n\nActual volume of wall = 2.7 m³ x 0.3 = 0.81 m³\n\nNow that we know the actual volume of the wall, we need to determine how many bricks are needed to build it. We can do this by dividing the actual volume of the wall by the volume of a single brick:\n\nNumber of bricks needed = 0.81 m³ / 0.218 m³/brick = 3.75 bricks\n\nSince we are rounding to the nearest whole number, we will need 4 bricks (3.75 rounded up).

The dimensions of the brick are 190mm by 90mm by 57mm. To convert these measurements into meters, we can divide each dimension by 100:\n\nVolume of one brick = (190/100) x (90/100) x (57/100) m³ = 0.218 m³\n\nNow, we need to calculate the volume of the wall. The wall has a thickness of 1.5 bricks, so we will multiply the dimensions by 1.5:\n\nVolume of wall = (40/100) x (6/100) x (3/100) m³ x 1.5 = 2.7 m³\n\nSince we are using clay bricks, we need to account for the voids within the brick structure. The average porosity of a clay brick wall is around 30%, which means that about 30% of the space within the wall is filled with air or other gases. To calculate the actual volume of the wall, we can multiply the total volume by the porosity:\n\nActual volume of wall = 2.7 m³ x 0.3 = 0.81 m³\n\nNow that we know the actual volume of the wall, we need to determine how many bricks are needed to build it. We can do this by dividing the actual volume of the wall by the volume of a single brick:\n\nNumber of bricks needed = 0.81 m³ / 0.218 m³/brick = 3.75 bricks\n\nSince we are rounding to the nearest whole number, we will need 4 bricks (3.75 rounded up). Therefore, the answer is (A) 8,850 pieces."

Characteristics of AE agent: forms and evenly distributes minute independent air bubbles in concrete. The areas where bubbles are formed remain as air voids when dried, leading to a decrease in compressive strength. [Rebuttal] Answer 1 is correct. The textbook states that bleeding decreases. [Additional error report] The answer is 3 according to the workbook; it does not increase compressive strength. [Admin] Please verify with other textbooks and indicate the publisher when reporting. [Rebuttal] Since the question asks for the correct statement, 1 is correct—AE agent reduces unit water amount, which decreases bleeding. [Additional error report] The question itself is incorrect. According to another workbook, the same options are given but the question asks for the incorrect statement and the answer is 3, because it should be \"decreases\" compressive strength. Options 1, 2, and 4 are correct. [Additional error report] Options 3 and 4 are incorrect; 1 and 2 are correct. Please correct this: it decreases both bond strength to rebar and compressive strength. It’s true that bleeding and chemical resistance are improved. [Additional error report] In the workbook, the answer is 3, since it’s incorrect to say it increases compressive strength. [Admin] Please verify with other textbooks and indicate the publisher. [Rebuttal] It’s listed as answer 1 in previous question books. Unless the question itself is wrong, statement 1 is correct. Statements 3 and 4 are obviously incorrect. [Rebuttal] The question and answer appear as is on page 406, question 37 of the Sungandang book. The correct answer is 1."

            "explanation": "1. Cork board – Made by crushing cork bark, placing it into a metal mold, and heating it by hot air or superheated steam while compressing it. It's lightweight, elastic, and offers good insulation and sound absorption (used as sound-absorbing material in broadcast studios, insulation in ice factories, and flooring in computer rooms, etc.). 2. Particle board (chipboard) – Made by mixing small wood pieces with organic adhesives like synthetic resin glue, then heating and compressing into boards. It has no directional strength, can be made in large panels, and adhesives may be mixed with waterproofing or mold inhibitors. It provides good sound and heat insulation and has a smooth, hard surface. 3. Copenhagen rib – Used for acoustic control in auditoriums, theaters, and assembly halls or as a wall finishing material in general buildings. 4. Flooring board – A type of floorboard processed for the surface, grooved and tongued, and installed directly on floor frames (used in school classrooms, gymnasiums, churches, auditoriums, etc.). Cork board and particle board can be confusing, as both involve heat and compression, but cork board is made from cork, while particle board is made from wood pieces. Remembering these differences makes it easy to answer this question."

Oak, maple, and beech are commonly used as flooring, leaving madica as the odd one out. Therefore, the correct answer is madica. To solve this question, you need to understand what 'flooring' means. Madica is a lightweight, soft wood mainly used for carving and crafts. Due to its low density and weak strength, madica is unsuitable for use as flooring and is primarily used for carving and decorative purposes."

        "model_answer": "To find the void ratio, we need to first calculate the total mass of the coarse aggregate. The total mass can be calculated using the unit volume weight and the oven-dry specific gravity. The oven-dry specific gravity is used to convert the mass of water in the aggregate into a mass of the aggregate itself.\n\nThe total mass of the coarse aggregate (in kg) can be calculated as follows:\n```scss\nTotal Mass = Unit Volume Weight * Oven-Dry Specific Gravity\n             = 1.7 kg/L * 2.65\n```\nNow that we have the total mass, we can calculate the void ratio using the following formula:\n```makefile\nVoid Ratio = (Total Mass - Mass of Water) / Total Mass\n              = (Total Mass - Mass of Water) / (Unit Volume Weight * Oven-Dry Specific Gravity)\n              = (1.7 kg/L * 2.65) - (Mass of Water / 1000) / (1.7 kg/L * 2.65)\n```\nNote that the mass of water in the aggregate is typically assumed to be 20% by weight of the total mass for coarse aggregates. This value can vary depending on the specific type of aggregate and the intended use in concrete, so it's important to check the relevant standards or specifications when using this formula.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n```scss\nVoid Ratio = (1.7 kg/L * 2.65) - (0.2 kg/m^3 / 1000) / (1.7 kg/L * 2.65)\n                = 0.48\n```\nTherefore, the void ratio of this coarse aggregate is approximately 48%.

As a reference, the answer will only be changed if there are more than five error reports. [Error report] The correct answer is number 4, which is a method of wood preservation using oil-based preservatives like creosote oil (which is brown, inexpensive, unattractive, used for exterior use, can't be painted over, and has a strong smell unsuitable for indoor use), as well as coal tar, asphalt, and water-based preservatives. [Additional error report] The correct answer is number 4 as written in the technician’s manual. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Oil stain is widely used for staining wood due to its high penetration and low fading. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Creosote oil, suggested by others, is not a stain but an oil-based wood preservative. [Counterarguments] Number 1 is correct. Oil stain is the coloring agent for wood."
