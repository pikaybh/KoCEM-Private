Therefore:\n\nLd = f'b \\* D = 18mm \\* 20mm ≈ 360mm\n\nAs per IS 456, the minimum cover provided to the rebar should not be less than 50mm for tension reinforcement. Therefore, we need to check if our calculated Ld is greater than or equal to 50mm:\n\nLd = 360mm ≥ 50mm\n\nSo, the basic development length (in mm) of the tension reinforcement with respect to embedment length is 360mm."

Therefore, the total load on the beam is simply its own weight plus any additional vertical load:\n\n\\[ w = m\\_c g + L \\]\n\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2) and $L$ is the total length of the beam.

We can do this using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n$A_{bolt} = \\pi d^2 = \\pi (20 \\, \\text{mm})^2 = 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the net cross-sectional area of the tension member.

We can do this using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\n$A_{bolt} = \\pi d^2 = \\pi (20 \\, \\text{mm})^2 = 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the net cross-sectional area of the tension member. To do this, we subtract the area of the bolt from the gross area:\n\n$A_{net} = A_g - A_{bolt} = 3,477 \\, \\text{mm}^2 - 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2 = 3,077 \\, \\text{mm}^2$\n\nNow we have the net cross-sectional area of the tension member. We can find the gross cross-sectional area by adding the area of the bolt to the net cross-sectional area:\n\n$A_{gross} = A_{bolt} + A_{net} = 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2 + 3,077 \\, \\text{mm}^2 = 3,477 \\, \\text{mm}^2$\n\nTherefore, the gross cross-sectional area of the tension member is $A_{gross} = 3,477 \\, \\text{mm}^2$, and the net cross-sectional area is $A_{net} = 3,077 \\, \\text{mm}^2$.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) $ 2,909 mm^2 $."

Then we divide by $C = 0.90$, giving us the answer in cubic meters:\n\n$130m^3 / 0.90 = 144.4444m^3$\n\nTherefore, the amount of soil to be excavated is approximately $144.4444m^3$. However, none of the given options match this answer exactly, so it is not one of the options provided."

The section diagram shows the height of the walls and the thickness of the slabs.\n\nLet's start with calculating the concrete volume for each floor:\n\nFor the 1st floor:\nTotal area = $C_1 + G_1 + G_2 + S_1$\nConcrete volume = Total area \\* Wall thickness\nConcrete volume = $(C_1 + G_1 + G_2 + S_1) * h_w$\nwhere $h\\_w$ is the wall thickness.\n\nFor the 2nd floor:\nTotal area = $C_1 + G_1 + G_2 + S_1$\nConcrete volume = Total area \\* Wall thickness\nConcrete volume = $(C_1 + G_1 + G_2 + S_1) * h_w$\n\nNow, let's calculate the formwork area for each floor:\n\nFor the 1st floor:\nTotal area = $G_1 + G_2 + S_1$\nFormwork area = Total area \\* Floor thickness\nFormwork area = $(G_1 + G_2 + S_1) * h\\_f$\nwhere $h\\_f$ is the floor thickness.\n\nFor the 2nd floor:\nTotal area = $G_1 + G_2 + S_1$\nFormwork area = Total area \\* Floor thickness\nFormwork area = $(G_1 + G_2 + S_1) * h\\_f$\n\nSince we have the dimensions of each floor, we can calculate the concrete volume and formwork area by plugging in the values. However, without specific numerical values given for $C\\_1$, $G\\_1$, $G\\_2$, $S\\_1$, $h\\_w$, $h\\_f$, it is impossible to provide an exact answer. The options provided do not match the general formulas we derived above, so none of them are correct."

We also need to find the number of bolts $N_s$, which can be found using the formula $N_s = \\frac{P \\cdot l}{d \\cdot \\mu}$, where $P$ is the load on the connection, $l$ is the length of the bolts, and $d$ is the bolt diameter. Let's assume the load on the connection is $P = 500kN$.\n\nNow we can calculate the design slip resistance using the formula $\\phi R_n = \\phi \\cdot \\mu \\cdot h_{sc} \\cdot T_o \\cdot N_s$, where $\\phi$ is the coefficient of friction between the beams and the bolts. Let's assume $\\phi = 0.5$.\n\nFirst, we need to find $h_{beam}$. Since we don't know the exact dimensions of the beams or their heights, let's assume $w_1 = w_2 = 300mm$ and $h_{beam} = 50mm$. Then we have:\n\n$b_1 = w_1 + 2 \\cdot h_{beam} = 300mm + 2 \\cdot 50mm = 400mm$\n\n$b_2 = w_2 + 2 \\cdot h_{beam} = 300mm + 2 \\cdot 50mm = 400mm$\n\nNow we can find $N_s$:\n\n$N_s = \\frac{P \\cdot l}{d \\cdot \\mu}$\n\nAssuming the bolt diameter is $d = 12mm$, the length of the bolts is $l = 60mm$, and $\\mu = 0.5$, we have:\n\n$N_s = \\frac{500kN \\cdot 60mm}{12mm \\cdot 0.5} = 833$\n\nNow we can find the value of $h_{sc}$:\n\n$h_{sc} = \\frac{b_1 + b_2}{2} = \\frac{400mm + 400mm}{2} = 400mm$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the design slip resistance:\n\n$\\phi R_n = \\phi \\cdot \\mu \\cdot h_{sc} \\cdot T_o \\cdot N_s = 0.5 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 400mm \\cdot 200kN \\cdot 833$\n\n$\\phi R_n = 1066.5 kN/m^2$\n\nNow we can check our answer:\n\n(A) The bolt specification is inappropriate. (wrong, the bolts are high-strength M22 bolts which are appropriate)\n\n(B) The number of bolts is insufficient. (wrong, there are 833 bolts which is sufficient according to the given design parameters)\n\n(C) The number of high-strength bolts is appropriate. (correct)\n\n(D) The slip coefficient is low. (wrong, the slip coefficient is assumed to be 0.5 and not considered low)\n\n(E) The number of bolts is excessive. (wrong, there are 833 bolts which is sufficient according to the given design parameters)"

However, we can use the given options to check which one is closest to the correct answer.\n\nFrom the given options:\n\n(A) $ 85,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $\n(B) $ 80,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $\n(C) $ 87,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $\n(D) $87,000 \\text{ mm}^3 $\n(E) $ 77,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n(A) $ 85,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $ - This is too large compared to the other options.\n(B) $ 80,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $ - This is closer to the correct answer than option (A).\n(C) $ 87,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $ - This is larger than option (B), which means it's not the correct answer.\n(D) $87,000 \\text{ mm}^3 $ - This is smaller than option (B).\n(E) $ 77,500 \\text{ mm}^3 $ - This is too small compared to the other options.\n\nBased on these observations, option (B) $80,500 \\text{ mm}^3$ seems to be the closest to the correct answer. However, without knowing the actual dimensions of each rectangle, it's difficult to say for certain which option is the exact answer."

Let's assume that each transport vehicle can carry 12 cubic meters per trip.\n\nNumber of trips = total excavation volume / transport vehicle capacity\nNumber of trips = 150 cubic meters / 12 cubic meters per trip\nNumber of trips = 12.5 trips (round down to whole number)\n\nc. To calculate the elevation of the area when it is filled and compacted, we need to know the volume of soil that will be added to the area and the excavation depth. Let's assume that the area will be filled to a height of 4 meters above its original elevation.\n\nElevation = (excavated soil volume + added soil volume) / horizontal surface area x 3\nElevation = [(150 cubic meters + 5,000 m² x 4 meters) x 3] / 5,000 m²\nElevation = 2.89 meters (round to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\na.

We can then sum up these weights to obtain the total weight of gravel required to make 1 m³ of concrete.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weights of various ingredients:\n\n- Water content (as given): 160 kg/m³\n- Cement weight: (50% water-cement ratio) \\* 160 kg/m³ = 80 kg/m³\n- Fine aggregate weight: (40% fine aggregate ratio) \\* 160 kg/m³ = 64 kg/m³\n- Coarse aggregate weight: (60% coarse aggregate ratio) \\* 160 kg/m³ = 96 kg/m³\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight of gravel required to produce 1 m³ of concrete:\n\nTotal weight of gravel = Water content + Cement weight + Fine aggregate weight + Coarse aggregate weight\n\nTotal weight of gravel = 160 kg/m³ + 80 kg/m³ + 64 kg/m³ + 96 kg/m³\n\nTotal weight of gravel = 320 kg/m³\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 900.0 kg/m³."
