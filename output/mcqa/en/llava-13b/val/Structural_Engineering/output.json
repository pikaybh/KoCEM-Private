The second moment of area for a simply supported concrete beam with width b and height h can be calculated as:\n\nI = b^2 \\* L / 4 + bh^2\n\nwhere b is the width of the beam (which we don't know) and h is the thickness of the beam. Since this is a minimum thickness problem, we want to find the value of h that makes I as small as possible while still satisfying the requirement for h0. We can do this by setting dI/dh = 0 and solving for h:\n\ndI/dh = 8 \\* b / 4 + 2h = 0\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh = (8 \\* b) / (4 + 8) = 16/5 b\n\nSubstituting this expression for h into the formula for h0, we can solve for b:\n\nh0 = (400*8^3)/(360*50*I)\n\nI = (16/5 \\* b)^2 \\* 8 / 4 + (16/5 \\* b \\* h0)^2\n\nSimplifying and rearranging terms, we get:\n\nb^2 = 960(h0)^2 / (720(fy)L^3)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nb^2 = 960(400 \\* 8^3 / (360\\*50)) / (720(400)(8))\n\nb^2 = 19200\n\nb = sqrt(19200) = 400mm\n\nSubstituting b into the expression for h, we get:\n\nh = (8 \\* 400) / (4 + 8) = 320mm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the beam is 320mm. However, since this value does not correspond to any standard concrete beam dimensions, it's likely that there is an error in the problem statement or the solution.
