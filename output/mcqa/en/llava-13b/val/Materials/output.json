Compared to sapwood, heartwood has less shrinkage and greater weather resistance, durability, and strength. Sapwood is found near the outer bark and is lighter in color. It has greater shrinkage and lower weather resistance, durability, and strength compared to heartwood.

Flat grain runs tangentially to the annual rings, is rough and irregular, and is used for board lumber."
