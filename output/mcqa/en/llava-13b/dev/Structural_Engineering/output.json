The truss is in equilibrium, so the sum of all forces in any direction must be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\nHorizontal force = -vertical force\n\nThe horizontal force at point A due to the 50 kN load is 50 kN \\* cos(30 degrees) = 42.5 kN. The vertical force due to the 50 kN load is 50 kN \\* sin(30 degrees) = 27.5 kN.\n\nSince the truss is in equilibrium, the sum of all forces acting on it must be zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n42.5 kN - 27.5 kN = -27.5 kN (since the negative sign indicates that this force is directed upwards)\n-27.5 kN + 10 kN (from the 10 kN load on the right side of the truss) = -17.5 kN\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the reaction force at hinge point A is 17.5 kN, which corresponds to option C: 51.5 kN.",
