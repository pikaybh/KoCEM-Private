            "B": "In base preparation, the absorption of the substrate is regulated before plastering, but wetting the surface is prohibited in order to maintain adhesion.",
            "C": "The brown coat forms the main body of the plaster and determines the flatness of the finished surface and quality of construction.",
            "D": "Since the finish coat uses more cementitious materials and finer aggregates, it should be applied as thinly as possible to prevent defects like cracking, and it is important to eliminate trowel marks."

            "explanation": "High-quality materials should be used, with precise mixing and thorough blending. The substrate should be properly wetted and roughened. Plaster should be applied thinly in several layers, with a standard thickness of 6mm per coat except for floors. There should be sufficient time (at least 2 weeks) between the scratch and brown coats. Rapid drying and vibrations during construction or curing should be avoided. Excessively fine sand should not be used for plastering."

The correct answer will be updated to reflect feedback if more than five reports are received. [Error report:] According to my studies, a 300mm × 300mm plate (30 cm square) is commonly used for plate load tests, where bearing capacity is determined by loading the plate and measuring settlement. [Counterargument:] Option 1 is correct. The bearing capacity test is the plate load test, and according to the standard (as referenced in the Eumunsa Construction Industry Engineer book), a 45 cm square plate (area of 2000 cm²) is the standard."
