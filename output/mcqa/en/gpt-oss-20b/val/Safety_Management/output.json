                "thinking": "We need to identify the incorrect statement among the four. These relate to installation standards for temporary passageway structures. Likely about scaffold, slope, landings etc.\n\nLet's parse each:\n\n(A) The slope should be 30 degrees or less. Usually for temporary passageways, slope limit is 30 degrees. That seems correct.\n\n(B) If the slope exceeds 20 degrees, the structure should be non-slip. Usually if slope >20°, it should be non-slip or have non-slip surfaces. That seems plausible.\n\n(C) For scaffold stairs used in construction work that are 8 meters or higher, landings should be installed at intervals of no more than 7 meters. For scaffold stairs: I think landings every 5 meters? Standard: For scaffold stairs >8m, landings every 5m? Let's recall typical standard: In construction scaffolds, landings are required at intervals not exceeding 5m for ladder-like? I'm not sure. But 7m seems high.\n\n(D) If the length of a temporary passageway installed in a vertical shaft is 15 meters or more, landings should be installed at intervals of no more than 10 meters. For vertical shafts, landings every 10m? That seems okay.\n\nWe need the NOT correct: likely (C). Because 7m might be too large. The standard might be 5m for scaffolding stairs.\n\nThus answer C."

This likely refers to the Hawthorne effect: that people's behavior changes when they know they're being observed, and that social factors influence productivity. But the phrase \"importance of human relationships is implied to have as much influence on productivity as work and workspace design\" maybe refers to \"Hawthorne effect\" which was about the influence of social relations and attention on productivity. However, Hawthorne effect originally studied the effect of lighting on productivity. The term \"Hawthorne effect\" has been generalized to \"people are influenced by being observed\". But is the question asking about a theory that implies human relationships equal influence on productivity as physical environment? Another possibility is \"Theory X and Y\" by McGregor about human motivation, but not exactly about relationships. \"Five stages of human needs\" maybe Maslow, not this. \"Effects of human resource development\" might be something but less likely.\n\nThe phrase \"importance of human relationships is implied to have as much influence on productivity as work and workspace design\" seems like the idea that the human relations aspect is as important as physical conditions. That aligns with \"Hawthorne effect\" which revealed that worker productivity improved due to the feeling of being considered, social interactions. So I'd choose (D) Hawthorne effect."

The options: A omission error, B commission error, C extraneous error, D command error.\n\nWe need to recall Swain's classification of human error. Swain's classification: In the context of aviation? There is \"Swain's model of human error\", which includes types: commission errors, omission errors, etc. Independent action errors: those not dependent on other actions. The question: Which is NOT classified as an independent action error. Let's think.\n\nSwain's model: Types: 1) Omission errors: failure to act; 2) Commission errors: doing something wrong; 3) External errors? There are also \"extraneous errors\" maybe not independent? \"Command errors\" maybe something like misinterpretation of command? Let's research from memory: Swain's taxonomy: \"Error types\" include \"action errors\" such as omission, commission, and \"decision errors\" such as selection, etc. Independent action errors include commission and omission? Hmm.\n\nSwain's model: For \"independent action errors\", the classification: Independent errors are those that can occur independently, such as omission, commission, and \"extraneous\" errors? Wait.\n\nLet's think: There are \"Swain's taxonomy of errors\": 1) Omission errors: failure to perform an intended action; 2) Commission errors: performing an unintended action; 3) Mistakes: choosing an incorrect action; 4) Slips: failure in execution; 5) Lapses: forgetting; 6) Violation: intentional deviation.\n\nBut Swain specifically? Not recall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the classification: \"Swain (1972) error types: independent errors: omission, commission, command; extraneous error? Hmm.\n\nLet's search memory: \"Swain, K. M. (1973) Human error classification.\" The independent action errors include \"commission errors, omission errors, command errors\". \"Extraneous errors\" are something else? Actually extraneous errors are \"errors caused by external factors\"? Hmm.\n\nLet's analyze the term \"extraneous error\" - In Swain classification, \"extraneous error\" refers to errors not directly due to the operator's actions but due to environmental or system factors. That might be not classified as an independent action error. So answer likely C: extraneous error.\n\nBut let's double-check: Are command errors independent? Command errors are when operator misinterprets or incorrectly issues commands. That is an action error. Omission and commission are action errors. Command also is action. Extraneous error is not an action but a system-level error? So extraneous error is NOT classified as independent action error.\n\nThus answer: C."

It's a soil testing method used in geotechnical engineering. The SPT measures resistance of soil to penetration. The standard procedure is to drive a split-spike into the ground using a 2.5 m hammer with 40.5 kg weight, dropped from a height of 760 mm (30 inches) onto the tip of a standard soil sampling barrel. The test is usually performed in 6 or 8 blows, with the first two being usually discarded. The number of blows (N) required to drive the piston 30 cm (12 inches) is recorded.\n\nWe need the relationship between N and relative density of sand. In standard guidelines, there is a correlation:\n\n- N ≤ 25: very loose sand.\n- 25 < N ≤ 35: loose sand.\n- 35 < N ≤ 45: medium sand.\n- N > 45: dense sand.\n\nBut I should confirm typical values. Many references mention that:\n\n- N < 25: very loose\n- 25-35: loose\n- 35-45: medium\n- >45: dense\n\nBut the question says: N >= 50. That seems high, so maybe \"very dense\".\n\nAlternatively, some texts mention ranges: N < 25 very loose, N 25-35 loose, 35-45 medium, >45 dense, but 45-55 is very dense? Some differences: some guidelines use N < 25: very loose, 25-35: loose, 35-45: medium, >45: dense. Some may say N > 55: very dense.\n\nBut the question: \"relative density of sand when the number of blows (N) required for a 30cm penetration is 50 or more?\" So they want relative density classification. So answer: Very dense.\n\nThus choose (D)."

Let's think: In Chinese \"Construction project hazardous risk prevention plan\" requirements: For high-rise building, high-risk, etc. For bridge construction, perhaps the threshold is 60m. I'm not sure. Let's search memory: There's a standard that says: For bridge construction projects with maximum span >50 m, need hazardous risk prevention plan. Might be 50m.

                "thinking": "We need to choose the standard for seat height of a chair used by many people. Typically seat height is designed for 5th percentile to accommodate small people? Or for 50th? Let's recall ergonomics: Seat height is usually set to accommodate the lower leg length, often based on the 5th percentile male or 5th percentile female? Wait, the standard for seat height often uses the 5th percentile female popliteal height? Actually, seat height is usually determined based on the lower leg length. For office chairs, seat height adjustable to suit different users. The question: \"What is the most appropriate standard for designing the seat height of a chair used by many people?\" This implies a chair that will be used by many, so we need to choose a standard that fits most people. Typically you use the 5th percentile for seat height to ensure that at least 95% can use the chair? Hmm.\n\nLet's think: Seat height standard often uses 5th percentile female popliteal height to ensure that a large proportion of the population can sit without feet hanging. But the question maybe expects \"75th percentile popliteal height\"? Wait, in ergonomic design, seat height is set to accommodate the lower leg length such that the foot rests flat on the floor. For the general population, you might choose the 5th percentile female, which ensures that 95% can use it. Actually typical design is to base on 5th percentile female. But the question gives options: 5th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentile. The most appropriate standard for designing the seat height of a chair used by many people likely uses the 5th percentile female to accommodate the smallest person? But for many people, seat height often set for the 5th percentile of the lower leg length? Actually let's recall guidelines: For office chairs, seat height is adjustable between 45 and 65 cm, and the design might be based on 5th to 95th percentile of lower leg length. But if designing a single seat height (non-adjustable), you might use the 5th percentile of the user group? Wait, design for many people: If you cannot adjust, you should design for the 5th percentile lower leg length, which is the smallest leg length. But the question: \"What is the most appropriate standard for designing the seat height of a chair used by many people?\" Many people implies the seat height should accommodate the majority of users. In ergonomics, the 5th percentile is used for the smallest leg length for a chair that can be used by the majority of the population. However, to accommodate 95% of the population, you would design for the 5th percentile. Actually, the seat height is typically designed to meet the lower leg length of the 5th percentile male/female? Let's recall: Seat height should be between 4 and 6 inches below the ground? Eh.\n\nBut typical design guidelines: For office chairs, seat height should be adjustable to fit 5th to 95th percentile. But for fixed chairs, the standard is 5th percentile female. Wait, think about the question: \"most appropriate standard for designing the seat height of a chair used by many people?\" They give percentiles: 5th, 50th, 75th, 95th. The 5th percentile is the smallest; 95th is the largest. If you design for the 95th percentile, that seat would be too high for most. So the correct answer likely is 5th percentile. But is that the \"most appropriate standard\"? Might be 5th percentile popliteal height.\n\nThus answer: (A)."

                "thinking": "The question: \"Which type of human error can be eliminated through safety education? (A) command error (B) multi error (C) primary error (D) secondary error\"\n\nWe need to recall safety engineering and human error classification. In human reliability analysis, errors are often classified as \"primary errors\" (slips, lapses, mistakes) and \"secondary errors\" (errors in safety procedures? Not sure). \"Command error\" maybe referring to \"command and control\" errors. \"Multi error\" maybe refers to \"multiple errors\".\n\nBut which type can be eliminated through safety education? I'd think \"primary error\" includes mistakes that are due to knowledge or training deficiency. Primary errors like \"mistake\" can be reduced with training. However, secondary errors may be system design errors that are beyond individual control. Command errors might be due to misinterpretation of command.\n\nLet me think: In the \"Swiss cheese model\", primary errors are slips, lapses, mistakes. Secondary errors are errors in system safeguards that allow primary errors to occur. Safety education can eliminate primary errors because they are due to lack of knowledge or misinterpretation. So answer likely C.\n\nBut \"command error\" is also a type of error: maybe errors in issuing commands. That also can be addressed by training. But I'm not certain. I think primary error is the one addressed by education.\n\nThus answer: (C)."

This seems like HCI or ergonomics. Six stages of HMI design: 1) Determine objectives and performance specs; 2) define system; 3) conceptual design; 4) interface design; 5) evaluate; 6 ... Let's think.

But the question says \"When dividing the design of human-machine systems into six stages, what is carried out in the first stage?\" Option D: Determining the objectives and performance specifications of the system. That seems like first stage: define objectives. Option B: Definition of the system might be second stage. So answer likely D.\n\nCheck typical sources: \"Six-stage HMI design process: 1.

                "thinking": "We need to answer with the option letter from given choices. The question: \"What safety device must be attached to an AC arc welder?\" The options: (A) Anti-shock device, (B) Overload protection device, (C) Automatic electric shock prevention device, (D) Two-person operation safety device.\n\nI think typical safety device for an AC arc welder: Must have an automatic electric shock prevention device (also known as a \"no-contact\" or \"arc extinguishing\" device? Hmm. In welding, for AC arc welder, you need an automatic electric shock prevention device? Let's think.\n\nIn welding, there are safety devices: Overload protection device (like circuit breaker), anti-shock device (ground-fault interrupter?), automatic electric shock prevention device (could be a safety ground interlock?), two-person operation safety device (rare). The question likely from a vocational test about welding. For AC arc welding, you need an \"automatic electric shock prevention device\". The reason: AC arc welders can be more dangerous because the AC can cause more severe shock. The safety device might be a \"no contact\" or \"automatic electric shock prevention device\" that will cut off current if the welder is not properly grounded.\n\nAlso \"anti-shock device\" could refer to the GFCI (ground-fault circuit interrupter). But that is common. But the phrase \"must be attached to an AC arc welder\" suggests a device that ensures the welder cannot be used without the protective device attached. That could be the \"automatic electric shock prevention device\".\n\nThus answer: (C).\n\nDouble-check: In the US, for welding, there's a requirement: The welding equipment must have a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI). That might be called an \"anti-shock device\" too. But the phrase \"automatic electric shock prevention device\" might be the same.\n\nBut the question: \"What safety device must be attached to an AC arc welder?\" Possibly the \"Anti-Shock Device\". But the phrase \"anti-shock device\" is a generic term. But the answer likely \"Anti-shock device\". However the answer choices include \"Anti-shock device\" and \"Automatic electric shock prevention device\". Which is correct?\n\nLet's search memory: In welding, the safety device required is called \"No-Contact Interlock\" or \"Automatic Electric Shock Prevention Device\"? Let's recall standard codes: OSHA requires a safety ground interlock device on all welding machines. But also GFCI. In many texts, the requirement is a \"no-contact interlock device\" for arc welding equipment, but that might be \"two-person operation safety device\"? No.\n\nThe \"Two-person operation safety device\" refers to welding at high voltages where you need a second person to hold the handle. Not likely.\n\n\"Overload protection device\" is a circuit breaker but not mandatory for the welder itself.\n\n\"Anti-shock device\" is likely the GFCI.\n\n\"Automatic electric shock prevention device\" might be a device that automatically disconnects power if a fault is detected. That is essentially the GFCI.\n\nBut which one is called \"Automatic electric shock prevention device\"? In welding, the safety device is often called \"anti-shock device\" or \"ground-fault circuit interrupter\" (GFCI). The GFCI is indeed an \"automatic electric shock prevention device\" because it automatically interrupts the circuit if there is a ground fault. So the phrase \"automatic electric shock prevention device\" might refer to a GFCI.\n\nThus answer is C."

But compatibility refers to working with existing components? Maybe \"compatibility\" means designing to be compatible with existing systems or standards. The faucet example uses color-coded red for hot: a standard convention for indicating hot water. So it's compatible with the user's expectation. But left-handed glove is also tailored to left-handed people. But compatibility is about ensuring that a new design can coexist with existing design/standard. The faucet color-coded is about meeting user expectations and standard color coding. I'd say (B) best example of compatibility in design.

The question: \"Which of the following cannot be considered as the authority granted to a leader by the organization?\" Options: (A) Legitimate authority, (B) Expert authority, (C) Coercive authority, (D) Reward authority.\n\nWe know that in classical organizational theory (e.g., Max Weber's types of authority), we have legitimate authority (also known as rational-legal authority), expert authority (expertise-based authority), and referent authority (based on charisma or respect). But coercive authority (force or fear) and reward authority are also part of leadership tactics, but they might not be granted by the organization. The question asks \"cannot be considered as the authority granted to a leader by the organization.\" Usually the organization grants legitimate authority (through position) and reward authority (the right to reward). Coercive authority is typically the right to punish. In some frameworks, reward authority is a type of authority. But is reward authority considered as authority granted by the organization? Yes, many sources say that legitimate authority includes the authority to reward and punish. However, the question might be based on \"types of authority\" in leadership: legitimate, referent, expert, and coercive. Wait, no. According to French and Raven's bases of social power, there are five: legitimate, reward, coercive, expert, and referent. Actually, French & Raven (1959) list 5 bases of power: reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, referent power, expert power. So reward authority is indeed an authority granted by the organization. Coercive is also a type. Legitimate is definitely. Expert is not a type of authority granted by the organization but rather by competence. So which cannot be considered as authority granted to a leader by the organization? That would be expert authority because it's based on expertise, not formal organization-granted authority. The question may be about \"authority granted by organization\" meaning formal positions: legitimate, reward, and coercive. Expert authority is not formally granted. So answer: B. Let's answer B."

Actually five requirements: reliability, validity, objectivity, economy, feasibility. So certainty is not. Subjectivity is the opposite of objectivity. The question asks which is NOT one of the five requirements: Certainty? Or Subjectivity? Let's recall typical list: \"Reliability, validity, objectivity, feasibility, economy\". So subjectivity is not. But the question's phrasing: \"Which of the following is NOT one of the five requirements of educational evaluation?\" It lists four options. Which of them is not in the list? Actually both certainty and subjectivity are not. But maybe \"certainty\" is a term used? No. They might consider \"Certainty\" as not. But typical requirement: \"Reliability, Validity, Objectivity, Cost-effective/Economy, Practicality.\" So \"Certainty\" is not. Also subjectivity is not. But they probably choose \"Certainty\" as answer because subjectivity is also not? Wait, the five requirements are: reliability, validity, objectivity, economy, feasibility. So \"certainty\" is not. \"Subjectivity\" is also not. But maybe they want the one that is not in list: \"Certainty\". Which one is listed incorrectly? \"Subjectivity\" is obviously not a requirement, but it's a negative of objectivity. The question might be trick: \"which is NOT one of the five requirements?\" Both certainty and subjectivity are not. But maybe \"certainty\" is incorrectly phrased. The correct answer probably is (D) Subjectivity. But which one is correct? Let's see if \"certainty\" could be considered requirement? Not typical. So maybe they think certainty is requirement? But no. \"Certainty\" isn't used. The term \"certainty\" might refer to \"certainty of results\" similar to reliability? But no.\n\nLet's research typical requirements: According to educational evaluation, five requirements: reliability, validity, objectivity, economy (cost-effectiveness), feasibility. So certainty is not, subjectivity is not. But the question is ambiguous. But maybe they assume that \"certainty\" is one of them? No. In some contexts, \"certainty\" might be used as requirement for evaluation? But improbable. The safe answer: (D) Subjectivity is not a requirement. But \"certainty\" is not either. Let's pick the one that is clearly not a requirement: \"Subjectivity\" (because evaluation should be objective). So answer (D)."

The slope is dangerous when the pore water pressure is high, i.e., fully saturated. Saturated slope means water has increased pore pressure, reducing effective stress, making slope more unstable. So the slope is at most dangerous when it's fully saturated. The answer is (D).\n\nBut need to double-check: Some slope failure can happen during rapid drawdown because the water pressure reduces quickly, causing changes in stresses and potentially causing landslides. However the question says \"most dangerous\" likely when fully saturated. For dams, water saturation increases pore pressure thus reduces effective stress. However if you have rapid drawdown, you might have undercutting at the toe, and cause instability due to slope movement. But which scenario is considered most dangerous? In dam slopes, the worst-case is when the slope is saturated, leading to high pore pressure, making slope unstable. The water level slowly decreasing is less dangerous. Completely dry slope is stable (no pore pressure). Rapid decreasing can cause instability due to changing water table and soil consolidation. But fully saturated is generally considered the worst. So answer: (D)."

Ladder-type passageway might be a safety ladder or a ladder that passes over a gap. The question: \"When installing a ladder-type passageway, how much must the top of the ladder extend above the point of support?\" Likely a code: at least 45 cm. Could be referencing Australian standard AS 1657 for fall protection or ladder safety. Let's think: Ladder type passageway - the top must extend at least 45 cm above the point of support. However might be 75 cm? Ladder top must extend at least 60 cm above the support? In OSHA, for a ladder used as a passageway, the top must extend at least 45 cm (18 inches) above the landing. I recall OSHA requirement: For a ladder used as a passageway, the top of the ladder must extend at least 18 inches (45 cm) above the landing. Actually I think it's 18 inches above landing. So answer (A). But check the exact phrasing: \"top of the ladder must extend at least 45 cm above the point of support.\" That seems likely. Thus answer A."

This seems like a regulation question. In many countries, minimum lighting for passageways may be around 150 lux? Wait: For work areas, 200 lux maybe. For passageways, 50 lux? But the question likely from a standard like OSHA or Canadian Safety Standard? For example, the UK HSE: passageways require 50 lux? Or in Australia? The question probably from some safety guidelines. Let's recall: In Australia, for passageways, minimum 150 lux? Wait, check: In the Australian Standard AS/NZS 2682:2013 – Indoor lighting – minimum light levels: Passageways: 300 lux? That seems too high. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, for US OSHA: \"General requirements for lighting\" say: \"minimum for passageways: 150 lux\"? Actually OSHA's standard 1910.22 requires illumination in certain areas. But for passageways, OSHA sets \"minimum of 300 lux for corridors\"? Not sure.\n\nThe question might be from a typical exam question for construction site safety: \"Minimum illuminance for passageways to allow safe passage: 300 lux\". But that value not in options. Options are 75, 80, 85, 90 lux. That indicates lower values. Maybe referencing British Standard BS EN 12831? Wait, that might say for corridors: 150 lux at ground level? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, might refer to \"Construction (Safety and Health) Regulations\" or \"OSHA 1910.22\" - the standard for worksite lighting says: \"Illuminance: 200 lux for passageways\" maybe? But again not in options.\n\nCould be a question from \"Workplace Safety for Construction Workers\" or \"Safety and Health at Work Act\"? Let's search memory: In the UK, the Minimum lighting levels: \"Office: 500 lux; Passageways: 200 lux; Working platforms: 500 lux; etc.\" That's typical. But 200 lux not listed.\n\nHowever, maybe the question refers to \"Minimum lighting in passageways as per the Australian Standard AS/NZS 4801\"? I'm not sure.\n\nLet's think: For \"Safety of workers in the workplace\" maybe the answer is \"At least 90 lux\" for passageways. Many guidelines: For passageways, a minimum of 100 lux (for emergency lighting). Hmm.\n\nBetter: Let's examine each option: 75, 80, 85, 90 lux. Which is likely correct? Many sources say 300 lux for passageways, but 75-90 lux is low. Maybe for \"temporary worksite lighting\" like on construction site, the minimum is 75 lux. For example, OSHA 1910.22 requires 75 lux for passageways.\n\nLet's confirm: OSHA 1910.22: Lighting in Work Areas: \"Illuminance levels for passageways shall be 300 lux at floor level.\" Wait, maybe that is not correct. Let's quickly search memory: OSHA standard 1910.22 says: \"Work area: 200 lux for work platforms; 75 lux for corridors and passageways.\" Yes, I think I recall that. Actually, yes: \"General lighting: 200 lux for work platforms, 75 lux for corridors/passageways.\" So answer would be 75 lux. Options include 75 lux as A. So answer likely A.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Let's check a typical OSHA lighting standard: \"Illuminance: 200 lux for work platforms; 75 lux for corridors and passageways.\" That matches. So answer: at least 75 lux.\n\nThus choose option A."

In many definitions, a system has functions: receiving input, storing information, processing information, outputting action. Storage might not be considered fundamental function. But some consider storage as part of processing. The question likely expects \"Information storage\" is NOT fundamental, because it's more about memory. The other three are fundamental. So answer C."

                "thinking": "We need to determine which statement is correct. Understand minimal cut sets: A minimal cut set is a minimal combination of basic events that, if they all occur, cause the top event. It's the smallest set that can cause top event. So (A) \"A minimal cut set is the smallest cut set that can cause the top event.\" That seems correct. Let's double-check other statements:\n\n(B) Minimal cut set represents reliability of system: Not exactly, it's about failure combinations; reliability is different.\n\n(C) Minimal path set represents risk: Minimal path set is a minimal set of basic events that lead to top event? Wait minimal path sets are minimal sets of components that, if all are working, allow system to function (i.e., top event). Actually in fault tree analysis, minimal path set is minimal set of events that allow the top event to occur? Let's recall: In fault tree, top event is failure event. Path sets are sets of basic events that cause top event? Actually minimal cut set is minimal set of component failures causing top event. Minimal path set is minimal set of component successes that will cause top event? Wait path sets refer to minimal sets of component failures? Let's review: In reliability, a minimal path set is a minimal set of components that, if all are working, ensures system success. But in fault tree analysis, top event is failure, so path sets are minimal sets of events that lead to the top event? Wait confusion.\n\nLet's check: In FTA, minimal cut sets are minimal sets of basic events (component failures) whose simultaneous occurrence leads to top event. Minimal path sets are minimal sets of component successes that ensure system success? Actually path sets refer to series/parallel representation of reliability? Let's think: In reliability block diagram, minimal path set refers to minimal set of components that, if all functioning, produce system success. In FTA, path set refers to minimal set of events that cause top event, but those events are success events? Wait top event is failure; path sets might be minimal set of failures? But then that's same as cut sets. So maybe path sets are for success events in reliability analysis. Usually minimal path sets are used in reliability analysis (like for series/parallel). Minimal cut sets are used for failure analysis. So path set in FTA context is minimal set of basic events that cause top event? But that would be cut set. So maybe they refer to \"minimal path set\" as minimal set of component successes that produce top event? No.\n\nLet's check definitions: In fault tree analysis, cut set is minimal set of basic events that if occur, cause top event. Minimal cut set: minimal such sets. Path set: minimal set of events that if all occur, cause the top event. Wait path set often used in reliability analysis: minimal path set is minimal set of components that will guarantee system operation if all are working. So in failure context, path set is minimal set of failures that will cause top event? But again.\n\nBut the question's options: (A) correct; (D) says \"A minimal path set is the minimal path set that can cause system failure.\" That's confusing: minimal path set that can cause system failure? Path set cause system failure? That would be a cut set. So likely wrong.\n\nThus (A) correct."

In slope stability, external causes are changes that affect the slope, like excavation, embankment, surcharge, rainfall, infiltration, etc. Internal causes: changes in material properties, internal stresses. External causes: changes in geometry, load, external conditions. So \"decrease in strength of soil and rock\" is an internal cause (material property change). So that's likely NOT external.
