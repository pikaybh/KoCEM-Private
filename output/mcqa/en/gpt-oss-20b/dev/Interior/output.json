(B) Where the compressive force is the least. (C) Where the tensile force is the least. (D) At a point one quarter of the span from the beam support.\n\nIn reinforced concrete beam splicing location typically near the mid-span or at the location of maximum tensile force? Actually splices should be placed in the region where the bending moment is maximum, i.e., midspan, or where the tension is highest. But the correct practice is to splice near the middle of the span where the bending moment is maximum? Let's think: For a simply supported beam under uniform load, maximum bending moment occurs at midspan, giving maximum tensile force at the bottom reinforcement. So splice location is recommended at midspan to reduce bending moment at splice. But some guidelines say splice should be located at the section where the bending moment is maximum or where tension is maximum. So answer would be (A) at half the span from support. That matches. But check alternative: Some say splicing should be where the tensile force is maximum to avoid reduction in moment. Option C says where tensile force is least, that seems wrong. Option B compressive force least - also wrong. Option D quarter span - less common.\n\nThus answer A. Let's answer \"A\".\n\n"

Actually, splicing main reinforcement bars: splice should be located in the region of maximum bending moment? Wait, the rule: \"Splices for longitudinal reinforcement should be placed at least a certain distance from the support, and usually in the region of maximum moment.\" For beams, the bending moment is highest near supports for simply supported beams with central load, but for symmetrical loads, midspan. Actually for a simply supported beam with uniform load, the bending moment is maximum at midspan. For a fixed-end beam with uniform load, maximum moment at supports. The idea: \"Splicing should be performed in the area of highest moment, not where moment is zero.\" And splices should not be placed where bending moment is zero, as that could cause stress concentration. Actually, the correct practice: splices for main bars should be placed at least 0.1d from the support, but ideally at the location of maximum moment. So the answer likely \"Where the tensile force is minimal\"? Wait, in a beam, tensile force is maximum at midspan for bending (when positive bending). Actually, for a simply supported beam, the top is in compression, bottom in tension. The tensile force is highest at midspan. So splicing where tensile force is minimal would be near supports. But typical guidelines: The splice should be in the middle of the beam's effective depth and near the region of maximum bending moment. Actually, let's research memory: According to ACI 318, splice location should be such that the splice and its bond length lie within the region of significant bending. The splice should not be placed where the moment is zero (like at the support for a simply supported beam). Wait, zero moment at support? For simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load, moment at support is zero indeed. So splicing near the support (where moment zero) is not recommended. So splice should be away from supports.\n\nHence the correct answer likely \"At a point halfway (1/2) along the span from the beam support\" or \"At a point one-fourth (1/4) along the span from the beam support\"? Which is best? Typically, the splice location should be at or near the middle of the beam for uniform loading. So 1/2 of span. However, guidelines say splice at or near the mid-span region (the maximum moment). So answer A.\n\nBut Option C says \"Where tensile force is minimal\" which would be near supports (like 0) but splicing near supports is not recommended. So that is wrong. Option B says \"Where compressive force is minimal\" which is same as tensile? Actually compressive force is maximal at midspan for bottom tension, top compression? For simply supported with central load, compression maximum at midspan too. So minimal at supports. So B also near supports. So not correct.\n\nOption D says 1/4 along span from support. That is not center. That is 1/4. So likely not the best.\n\nThus answer A."
