(Main bars: 4-D25, Hoop: D10)\"\n\nWe don't have diagram but typical design: For hoop spacing in reinforced concrete columns: spacing not exceed 300 mm, or as per code: for columns with hoops, spacing no more than 300 mm or 400 mm? Let's recall: For longitudinal bars 4-D25, hoop diameter D10. Maximum spacing per code? For columns, hoop spacing S <= 300 mm or maybe S <= 400 mm? Many codes: For column ties, spacing S <= 300 mm (or 400 mm for special?). But given options 350, 400, 480, 500 mm. Likely answer is 400 mm? But need reasoning: The main bars are 4-D25, hoop D10. The ratio? For a D10 hoop, spacing maybe 400 mm. I think 400 mm is typical maximum. 350 mm is also possible but less common. Let's pick 400 mm.\n\nThus answer B."

                "thinking": "We need to compute reaction at hinge A, magnitude of vector sum of horizontal and vertical components. The problem: \"truss shown in the drawing\" – we don't have drawing. Must infer typical scenario: maybe a simple truss with known loads and geometry? The options: 50.8, 51.4, 51.5, 52.1 kN. Likely near 51.5. Maybe the exact answer is 51.5 kN. But need some reasoning.\n\nWe need to assume standard scenario: a truss with loads, maybe 100 kN at a joint, distances etc. We can't see the drawing.\n\nGiven typical design: reaction at hinge A: magnitude sqrt(Ra_x^2 + Ra_y^2). Maybe reaction components: horizontal 30 kN, vertical 45 kN? sqrt(30^2+45^2)= sqrt(900+2025)= sqrt(2925)=54.07. Not matching options.\n\nTry horizontal 40, vertical 35: sqrt(1600+1225)= sqrt(2825)=53.17.\n\nTry horizontal 33, vertical 45: sqrt(1089+2025)= sqrt(3114)=55.84.\n\nWe need 50.8-52.1.\n\nTry horizontal 30, vertical 40: sqrt(900+1600)= sqrt(2500)=50.0. Too low.\n\nTry 25, 45: sqrt(625+2025)= sqrt(2650)=51.48. That's close to 51.5. So if horizontal 25 kN, vertical 45 kN, magnitude ~51.5 kN.\n\nThus answer might be (C) 51.5 kN.\n\nBut maybe actual calculation yields 51.5. So choose (C)."
