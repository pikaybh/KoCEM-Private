Likely \"efficiency rate\" is ratio of rentable area to gross floor area (total floor area). In office building, \"efficiency\" often means rentable area divided by gross floor area, i.e., ratio of usable (rental) to total building area. That matches option B: ratio of rentable area to total floor area. Option D says standard floor area, not typical. So answer B."

The user likely refers to their own country, but we as AI don't know which. However, typical standard: In most of the world, third-angle projection is used (USA, Canada). In Europe and many other places, first-angle projection is used (ISO). In many Asian countries like India? I think India uses third-angle? Actually India follows British system historically, which uses third-angle? Wait: In engineering drawing, there are two main projection methods: first-angle (used in Europe, Asia) and third-angle (used in USA, Canada). Many Asian countries (including India, China) use third-angle? Let's recall: ISO standard uses third-angle? Actually ISO 5456-1: \"Third-angle projection is the method used in the United States, Canada, and Japan.\" Wait Japan uses third-angle? I think Japan uses third-angle as well. Many European countries use first-angle projection. So which \"our country\"? Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the context is that the user is from a particular country known for using first-angle? Maybe the default is first-angle projection (common in many countries). But the question seems like a typical exam question in some country where they teach first-angle projection. In many Asian countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, they teach first-angle? Actually I recall Indian engineering drawing uses first-angle projection (based on IS standards). Yes, the Indian Standard IS 1359 uses first-angle projection. So likely answer is First-angle projection (A).\n\nThus answer: A."
