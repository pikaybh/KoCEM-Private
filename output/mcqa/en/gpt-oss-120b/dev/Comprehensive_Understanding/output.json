There's no context given. As ChatGPT, we cannot see the plan. We must answer based on insufficient info? Possibly we cannot determine; but the instruction says answer with the option's letter directly. We could guess? Probably answer \"B\" as default? But could be ambiguous. However instruction says answer with the letter directly. We must choose. Since we have no info, perhaps answer \"B\"? Or maybe \"A\"? Hard to know. In such ambiguous scenario, maybe answer \"B\" indicating not appropriate. I'll pick \"B\"."

Might be typical size for AL (Aluminum) ceiling panels. Common sizes: 600x1200 mm is common. So 1200*600 mm (A). So answer A. Probably that."

However, we don't have context. This seems like a quiz about perhaps a specific article or textbook. Without context, we might guess typical lighting for parking lots: High-output fluorescent light? Or LED? Actually LED is not fluorescent; LED is separate. Parking lots often use high-output (HO) fluorescent or high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, or LED nowadays. Traditional older parking lots used high-output fluorescent lights, often \"high-output\" (HO) or \"high-intensity discharge\". Among choices, \"High-output fluorescent light\" seems plausible. So answer D."
