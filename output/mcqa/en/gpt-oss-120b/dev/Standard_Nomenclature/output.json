In construction, \"damming\" refers to creating a dam or water barrier, but in architecture context, damming is a method of waterproofing, using a damming system, i.e., using a damming material to prevent water infiltration. So the term \"Damming\" refers to \"Damming\" itself? The options: A is Damming. That seems tautological but likely the correct answer: Damming refers to the process of creating a dam or water barrier. So answer (A)."
