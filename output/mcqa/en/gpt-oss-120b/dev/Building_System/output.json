Need to pick the one that is NOT appropriate. Need knowledge: In HVAC zoning, methods include classifying rooms by usage purpose (e.g., office, conference), usage time (occupied/unoccupied), internal zones by floor, external zones by orientation (north/south) maybe? Actually external zones by orientation is used for heating/cooling loads because sun exposure matters. That seems appropriate. Internal zones per floor is also common. Classify according to usage time is also relevant (different setpoints). So which is NOT appropriate? Possibly \"Classify according to the purpose of each room.\" Actually that's typical: different functions have different loads. All seem appropriate. Maybe the trick: \"Create external zones according to orientation\" is less about zoning for AC planning? But orientation matters for load calculation. However zoning typically internal, not external? Hmm.\n\nLet’s think: Zoning in AC planning is dividing building into zones for independent control. Methods: By usage (e.g., office, conference), by occupancy schedule, by floor (vertical zoning), by orientation (exposure). All are used. Which is NOT appropriate? Could be \"Classify according to the purpose of each room\" maybe too granular? But it's common. Another angle: Zoning for AC is based on thermal loads, not purpose? Actually purpose determines load. So that is appropriate.\n\nMaybe the answer is D: external zones according to orientation is not typical for zoning, it's more for load calculation but not zoning. I'll pick D.\n\nThe instruction: answer with the option's letter directly. So output \"D\"."
