Splicing should be placed where bending moment (tensile stress) is minimal, i.e., near supports where compression dominates? Actually main tensile reinforcement is at bottom of beam, tension zone. Splice should be placed where bending moment is low to reduce effect of stress concentration. Typically splice location is at the point of minimum moment, often near support where moment is zero (or low). So answer: Where tensile force is minimal? Wait tensile force is low near supports because moment is low. So option C: Where the tensile force is minimal. Option B is compressive force minimal, not relevant. So answer C."

Evacuation devices: emergency lighting (helps evacuation), emergency escape descent device (like rope descent), automatic fire alarm system is a detection/notification system, not a device used for evacuation itself? It alerts, but not a device used for evacuation. However, the question likely expects that fire alarm is not evacuation device, but emergency lighting and descent device are. Artificial resuscitator (like a bag-valve mask) is not for evacuation; it's a medical device used for resuscitation. That is definitely not an evacuation device. So answer B."
