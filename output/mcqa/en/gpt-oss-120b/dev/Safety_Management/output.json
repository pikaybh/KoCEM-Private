What is the appropriate number to fill in the blank?\n\n(A) 5\n(B) 7\n(C) 10\n(D) 15\"\n\nBut we don't have the regulation text. Likely about wire rope splices cannot be used for lengths less than something? Maybe the number is a percentage? The regulation probably states \"The use of wire ropes with splices is prohibited when the splice length exceeds ____% of the rope length.\" Or maybe \"prohibited for use on lifts with a load greater than ____ times the rope's working load limit.\" Not sure.\n\nLet's think: Common regulations: In US OSHA, wire rope splices: \"The use of wire rope with a splice is prohibited where the splice is more than 1/8 inch in diameter?\" Hmm.\n\nMaybe referencing \"wire rope with a splice cannot be used for a length of 10 meters\"? The choices 5,7,10,15. Could be \"more than 7% of the rope's length\"? I'm not certain.\n\nSearch memory: In some standards, \"wire rope with a splice shall not be used where the splice is longer than 10% of the rope's length.\" That seems plausible. So answer C (10).

Not a safety rule; maybe about placing but not correct.\n\nB) Even if there is a risk of formwork collapse during concrete pouring, the work should be completed first before assessing the situation. That's unsafe, opposite.\n\nC) Concrete that has spilled onto the floor should be left to cure as is. That's not safe; should be cleaned.\n\nD) For the topmost slab, avoid cold joints as much as possible and pour the entire slab at once.
