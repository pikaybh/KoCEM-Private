Options:\n\nA: financial model\nB: measure of risk\nC: average insurance rates\nD: real estate transaction bond used as a guaranty when a fiduciary makes a sale.\nE: insurance policy that protects lender's interest.\n\nSale bond is a type of surety bond used in real estate transactions, often a \"sale and purchase bond\" or \"sale bond\" guaranteeing that the buyer will complete the purchase. It is a guarantee to the seller that the buyer will fulfill obligations. So D seems correct: a real estate transaction bond used as a guaranty when a fiduciary makes a sale. So answer D."
