So identify which statement is false.\n\nWe need knowledge about temporary passageway standards. Probably from some occupational safety regulations (e.g., Korean construction safety standards). Let's think:\n\n(A) slope should be 30 degrees or less. Usually, temporary passageways (like walkways) should not exceed 30 degrees? Possibly correct.\n\n(B) If slope exceeds 20 degrees, the structure should be non-slip. Probably correct: for slopes >20°, must have anti-slip.\n\n(C) For scaffold stairs used in construction work that are 8 meters or higher, landings should be installed at intervals of no more than 7 meters. Is that correct? Usually, landings required every 12 ft (~3.6 m) or maybe every 2 m? Not sure. 8 meters high stairs: intervals of 7 meters seems long. Probably wrong.\n\n(D) If length of a temporary passageway installed in a vertical shaft is 15 meters or more, landings should be installed at intervals of no more than 10 meters. That seems plausible.\n\nThus likely (C) is NOT correct. Answer with letter C."

I'm not fully sure, but I can recall that Swain (maybe Swain and Guttman) classified errors into slips, lapses, mistakes, etc. Independent action errors likely include omission errors, commission errors, maybe extraneous errors? Command errors maybe something else. Let's think.\n\nSwain's classification of human error: In the context of human factors, Swain (1974) identified three types: slip (action), lapse (memory), and mistake (planning). Independent action errors may refer to errors that are independent of the task, like command errors? Actually not sure.\n\nLet's try to recall: In aviation, Swain's classification includes \"action errors\" which are either \"slips\" (wrong execution) or \"mistakes\" (wrong planning). Within action errors, there are \"omission errors\" (failure to do something) and \"commission errors\" (doing something incorrectly). \"Extraneous errors\" maybe refer to errors not related to the task? \"Command errors\" maybe errors of giving wrong commands? I suspect \"extraneous error\" is not part of independent action errors.\n\nThus answer likely (C) extraneous error. Let's answer with C."

For a chair used by many, you would want to accommodate most users, typically design for 5th to 95th percentile. The seat height should be set at about 5th percentile to ensure most can sit with feet on floor? Actually seat height should be such that the majority can sit with feet flat: design for 5th percentile? Wait, for seat height, you want to accommodate shorter users, so you set seat height based on 5th percentile popliteal height (the shortest). However if you set too low, tall people may have to lift thighs. The typical ergonomic recommendation for a public chair (like a public seating) is to design for 5th percentile female popliteal height to accommodate the shortest 95% of users. So answer (A)."

Compatibility often means matching standards, e.g., right-hand drive car seat for right-hand traffic? Or maybe left-handed glove is \"fit\" for left-handed users, that's more about customization or adaptability. Compatibility could be like a faucet that dispenses hot water when turned to red - that's a sign convention compatibility. Air hammer designed to be quiet is about noise reduction (not compatibility). I think compatibility is about making a product work with existing standards or environments. A driver's seat on the right side matches driving on the right side of the road (or left side traffic). That's compatibility with traffic norms. So answer (A)."

Plate load test gives bearing capacity and settlement, can estimate shear strength parameters, but for sands?

Ladder-type passageway presumably a ladder used as a passage between floors. The top of the ladder must extend a certain distance above the landing or support for safety, maybe 300 mm? Not sure.\n\nIn many codes (e.g., Australian, US OSHA, etc.), the top of a ladder must extend at least 1 foot (300 mm) above the landing, or 1 meter? For portable ladders, the top should extend at least 1 foot (300 mm) above the landing. However this is ladder-type passageway (a fixed ladder). In Australian Standard AS 1657-1992 \"Fixed platforms, walkways, stairs and ladders\" maybe requires 300 mm (12 inches) above landing? Wait that's for portable ladders? Let's recall: The OSHA regulation for portable ladders: \"The top of the ladder shall extend at least 3 ft (0.91 m) above the landing.\" Actually for fixed ladders, the top landing must be a platform or walkway. But for a ladder-type passageway (like a ladder connecting two floors), the top must extend at least 450 mm above the landing? I'm not sure.\n\nSearch memory: In Canada, CSA B354.2 requires top of fixed ladder extend at least 300 mm above the landing. In UK? The Health and Safety Executive says top of ladder must extend at least 300 mm beyond the landing.\n\nBut the options are 45, 60, 75, 90 cm. 90 cm is about 3 feet. That matches US OSHA's \"at least 3 feet above the landing.\" So answer likely D: At least 90 cm.\n\nThus choose D."

I recall that OSHA requires 100 lux for general work areas, but for passageways maybe 75. Let’s think: The question likely from Chinese safety regulations? In China, the standard \"GB 50033-2013\" for lighting design: passageways require minimum 100 lux? Actually I think for emergency escape routes, at least 100 lux. But for passageways maybe 75 lux.

In systems theory, fundamental functions: detection (sensing), information processing/decision making, movement (actuation), maybe information storage? I think typical functions: sensing, processing, actuation, storage? I'm not entirely sure. Many frameworks include storage as part of processing. The question likely from a textbook on systems (e.g., \"Fundamental functions of a system: detection, information processing/decision making, and movement\".

Let's recall definitions:\n\nIn FTA, a cut set is a combination of basic events that leads to the top event (system failure). A minimal cut set is a cut set that is minimal, i.e., no proper subset of it is also a cut set. So A: \"A minimal cut set is the smallest cut set that can cause the top event.\" That's close but phrasing \"smallest\" ambiguous: minimal means no subset, not necessarily smallest in cardinality? Usually minimal cut set is a cut set where removal of any event eliminates the cause. So A is essentially correct.\n\nB: \"A minimal cut set represents the reliability of the system.\" No, cut sets represent failure combinations.\n\nC: \"A minimal path set represents the risk of the system.\" No.\n\nD: \"A minimal path set is the minimal path set that can cause system failure.\" Path sets are for success (top event is success). Minimal path set is a minimal combination of components that ensures system success, not failure. So D incorrectly says cause system failure.\n\nThus correct answer is A.
